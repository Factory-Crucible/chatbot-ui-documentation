## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a crucial part of the user interface, providing a visual indication of a loading state. The Spinner component is a reusable piece of the UI, and it can be utilized in various parts of the application where a loading state needs to be communicated to the user. The directory contains two files: `Spinner.tsx` and `index.ts`.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. It is a React component that renders an SVG-based spinner animation. The component accepts two optional props: `size` and `className`. The `size` prop controls the dimensions of the spinner, while the `className` prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component. It exports the default export from `Spinner.tsx`, simplifying imports elsewhere in the project.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the Spinner component, defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file. This component is crucial for indicating loading states within the application. It is designed to be reusable and customizable, with the ability to adjust its size and apply additional CSS classes.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate loading states. It can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` thanks to the `index.ts` file, which exports the default export from `Spinner.tsx`.

For example, the Spinner component might be used in a situation where data is being fetched from an API. While the data is being fetched, the Spinner component could be rendered to indicate to the user that the data is loading.

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

function DataFetchingComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData().then((fetchedData) => {
      setData(fetchedData);
      setLoading(false);
    });
  }, []);

  if (loading) {
    return <Spinner size="2em" className="my-spinner" />;
  }

  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

In this example, the Spinner component is rendered while the data is being fetched. The `size` prop is set to `"2em"`, making the spinner larger than its default size, and the `className` prop is set to `"my-spinner"`, allowing for additional styling via CSS.
