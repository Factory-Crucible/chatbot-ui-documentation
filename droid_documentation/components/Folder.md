## `components/Folder` Directory

The `components/Folder` directory is a part of the `chatbot-ui` project's component structure, specifically dedicated to the representation and interaction of a folder in a file system within the user interface. This directory contains two main files: `Folder.tsx` and `index.ts`. The `Folder.tsx` file is a React component that encapsulates the functionality and visual representation of a folder. The `index.ts` file simplifies the import process from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains the following files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. This component represents a folder in a file system within the user interface. It accepts several props, maintains its own state, and renders a button and an input field. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The component uses icons from the `@tabler/icons-react` package.

- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects to simplify imports from a directory.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It exports a `Folder` component that encapsulates the functionality and visual representation of a folder in a file system. The component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component renders a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the `chatbot-ui` project to represent a folder in a file system within the user interface. It is used in various parts of the project where a visual representation of a folder is required. The component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. The component maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Folder` component might be used:

```typescript
import Folder from '../components/Folder';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const currentFolder = {...}; // some folder object
  const searchTerm = 'example';
  const handleDrop = (e, folder) => {...}; // some drop handler function
  const folderComponent = [<FolderComponent />, <FolderComponent />]; // some folder components

  return (
    <Folder
      currentFolder={currentFolder}
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      handleDrop={handleDrop}
      folderComponent={folderComponent}
    />
  );
};
```

Please note that this is a simplified example and the actual usage of the `Folder` component may vary depending on the context within the `chatbot-ui` project.
