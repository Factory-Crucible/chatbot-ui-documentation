## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a part of a React application, containing TypeScript files and a subdirectory. It houses the `Promptbar` component, which represents a sidebar in the user interface, with functions for managing prompts and folders. The `Promptbar` component uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects. It also imports several other components such as `PromptFolders`, `PromptbarSettings`, and `Prompts`. The directory also includes a context file `PromptBar.context.tsx` which defines the context for the `Promptbar` component, including state and handlers for prompts. The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file defines the initial state and interface for the `Promptbar` component.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains the following files and subdirectory:

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This is a TypeScript context file for the 'PromptBar' component. It defines an interface 'PromptbarContextProps' which outlines the shape of the context, including the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `index.ts`: This is the entry point, exporting the 'Promptbar' component.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.
- `components`: This subdirectory contains related components. 'Prompts.tsx' renders a list of prompts, 'PromptbarSettings.tsx' is for 'Promptbar' settings, 'Prompt.tsx' manages prompts, 'PromptModal.tsx' renders a modal for editing prompts, and 'PromptFolders.tsx' manages folders within the 'Promptbar'.

### Key Components

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This file is crucial as it defines the context for the 'PromptBar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. This context is used throughout the 'PromptBar' component and its subcomponents to manage state and handle actions.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI. It is responsible for managing prompts and folders, and uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component. It is key to managing the state of the 'Promptbar' component.

### Usage & Examples

The `Promptbar` component is used within the application to provide a sidebar in the user interface for managing prompts and folders. It uses the context defined in `PromptBar.context.tsx` to manage state and handle actions. The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.

The `Promptbar` component imports several other components from the `components` subdirectory. For example, the `Prompts` component is used to render a list of prompts, the `Prompt` component is used to manage prompts, and the `PromptFolders` component is used to manage folders within the 'Promptbar'.

The `Promptbar` component is typically used in the application as follows:

```typescript
import Promptbar from 'components/Promptbar';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Promptbar />
    </div>
  );
}
```
