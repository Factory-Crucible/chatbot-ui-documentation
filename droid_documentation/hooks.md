## Hooks Directory

The Hooks directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. It contains two TypeScript files that define custom React hooks, `useCreateReducer.ts` and `useFetch.ts`. These hooks are integral to the state management and HTTP request handling of the chatbot-ui project. The `useCreateReducer` hook is used to create a typed reducer with dispatch and state, while the `useFetch` hook is used to make HTTP requests. Both hooks are designed to enhance the functionality and maintainability of the codebase, providing a structured and efficient way to manage state and handle HTTP requests.

### Contents

The Hooks directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named 'useCreateReducer' for creating a typed reducer with dispatch and state. It also defines two TypeScript types, 'FieldNames' and 'ActionType', for managing the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.

- `useFetch.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named 'useFetch' for making HTTP requests. It defines two types, 'RequestModel' and 'RequestWithBodyModel', to structure the request parameters. The hook provides methods for each HTTP verb and uses a helper function 'handleFetch' to perform the actual fetch operation.

### Key Components

The Hooks directory contains two key components:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file is a critical part of the state management in the chatbot-ui project. The 'useCreateReducer' hook it defines allows for the creation of a typed reducer with dispatch and state, enhancing the reliability and maintainability of the codebase. The 'FieldNames' and 'ActionType' types it defines are used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action, providing a structured and efficient way to manage state.

- `useFetch.ts`: This file is essential for handling HTTP requests in the chatbot-ui project. The 'useFetch' hook it exports provides a structured and efficient way to make HTTP requests, with methods for each HTTP verb. The 'RequestModel' and 'RequestWithBodyModel' types it defines structure the request parameters, and the 'handleFetch' helper function it uses performs the actual fetch operation, handling the response based on its content type and managing errors.

### Usage & Examples

The hooks defined in the Hooks directory are used throughout the chatbot-ui project to manage state and handle HTTP requests.

For instance, the 'useCreateReducer' hook might be used to manage the state of a chat conversation, with the 'initialState' argument set to an object representing the initial state of the conversation, and the 'FieldNames' and 'ActionType' types used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.

The 'useFetch' hook might be used to make an HTTP request to the OpenAI API, with the 'get' method used to make a GET request, the 'RequestModel' type used to structure the request parameters, and the 'handleFetch' helper function used to perform the actual fetch operation and handle the response.

Please note that these are hypothetical examples and may not represent the actual usage patterns in the chatbot-ui project.
