## components/Buttons

The `components/Buttons` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as a container for the various button components used throughout the user interface. These button components are integral to the user interaction with the chatbot, providing clickable elements that trigger various functionalities. The directory contains a subdirectory named `SidebarActionButton`, which houses the definition and export of a specific button component used in the sidebar of the chatbot UI.

### Contents

The `components/Buttons` directory contains a single subdirectory:

- `SidebarActionButton`: This subdirectory contains the definition and export of the `SidebarActionButton` component. It includes two files: `index.ts` and `SidebarActionButton.tsx`.

### Key Components

The `SidebarActionButton` subdirectory is a key component within the `components/Buttons` directory. It contains the following files:

- `SidebarActionButton.tsx`: This file defines the `SidebarActionButton` component, a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`. The `handleClick` prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the `children` prop renders any child elements within the button.
- `index.ts`: This file is a module export file that simplifies import paths by re-exporting the default export from `SidebarActionButton.tsx`.

### Usage & Examples

The `SidebarActionButton` component defined in this directory is used throughout the chatbot UI, particularly within the sidebar. It provides a clickable element that triggers various functionalities, depending on the `handleClick` function passed as a prop.

For example, a `SidebarActionButton` might be used to toggle the visibility of a settings panel. In this case, the `handleClick` function would be defined to toggle a state variable controlling the panel's visibility. The `children` prop could be used to render an icon or text label indicating the button's functionality to the user.

```typescript
<SidebarActionButton handleClick={toggleSettingsPanel}>
  <SettingsIcon />
</SidebarActionButton>
```

In this example, clicking the `SidebarActionButton` would trigger the `toggleSettingsPanel` function, toggling the visibility of a settings panel. The button would display a `SettingsIcon` component as its child element.
