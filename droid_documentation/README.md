Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the repository, including its purpose, technologies used, major components, conventions, structure, main flows, and testing principles. These docs are generated and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes by the Documentation Droid.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to provide a user interface for a chatbot application. It is a Docker-based Node.js project that uses TypeScript and various libraries and frameworks to create a responsive and interactive chatbot UI. This repository is a crucial part of a larger system, interacting with other services to provide a seamless user experience.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies. It uses Node.js as the runtime environment and TypeScript for static typing. The project uses React.js for building the user interface and Next.js for server-side rendering. For styling, it uses Tailwind CSS and PostCSS. The project also uses Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. 

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different aspect of the UI. The 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The '__tests__' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

### Conventions

The codebase follows several conventions. File names are in camelCase or kebab-case, depending on their purpose. Directory names are in lowercase. Test files are located in the '__tests__' directory and have the '.test.ts' extension. React component files have the '.tsx' extension and are located in the 'components' directory or its subdirectories. Utility functions are located in the 'utils' directory or its subdirectories.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into directories, each serving a specific purpose. The root directory contains configuration files for the project, Docker, and various tools. It also includes a Dockerfile for creating a Docker image and a 'docker-compose.yml' for defining and managing the Docker application. The 'package.json' file lists the project's dependencies and scripts. The 'public' directory contains branding files and a 'screenshots' subdirectory. The 'styles' directory contains a 'globals.css' file that holds the global styles for the project.

Here is a simplified `tree` visual of the directory structure:

```

├── __tests__
├── components
├── droid_documentation
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
├── public
├── services
├── styles
└── types
```

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the chatbot UI. The 'pages' directory contains the main entry points for the application. The 'index.tsx' file in this directory exports a React component and a server-side rendering function for the home page. The 'api' subdirectory within 'pages' contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different aspect of the UI. The 'Chat' subdirectory within 'components' constructs the chat interface of the application.

For a more in-depth understanding of the flow, refer to the following documentation files:

- [Chat Component](./droid_documentation/components/Chat.md)
- [Chatbar Component](./droid_documentation/components/Chatbar.md)
- [API Pages](./droid_documentation/pages.md)

### System Connections

The system interacts with external services such as OpenAI and Google APIs. The 'api' subdirectory within 'pages' contains files for handling these interactions. The 'models.ts' file handles requests related to OpenAI models, constructing URLs and fetching data from the OpenAI API. The 'chat.ts' file serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality, processing requests, encoding messages, and interacting with an OpenAI service. The 'google.ts' file handles API requests and responses, interacting with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API to generate prompts and send responses.

## Testing Principles

The '__tests__' directory is dedicated to testing in this project. It contains a subdirectory named 'utils', which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. The 'app' subdirectory within 'utils' contains a test file named 'importExports.test.ts'. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named 'cleanData', which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.
