## components/Search Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a part of the `chatbot-ui` project's component structure, specifically dedicated to the search functionality within the user interface. This directory encapsulates the logic and rendering of the search component, which is a critical part of the user interface, allowing users to search through the chatbot's content. The directory contains two main files: `Search.tsx` and `index.ts`. The `Search.tsx` file is a TypeScript React component that exports a functional component named 'Search'. This component is responsible for rendering the search input field and handling the search functionality. The `index.ts` file serves as the public interface for the directory, exporting the default from `Search.tsx`.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains the following files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that exports a functional component named 'Search'. The 'Search' component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the directory, exporting the default export from the sibling file 'Search.tsx'. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the 'Search' component defined in the `Search.tsx` file. This component is responsible for rendering the search input field and handling the search functionality. It accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' prop is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' prop is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.

### Usage & Examples

The 'Search' component is used within the `chatbot-ui` project to provide search functionality. It is a reusable component that can be used wherever a search input field is required. The component is used by passing the required props to it. Here is a simplified example of how it might be used:

```typescript
import Search from '../components/Search';

function SomeComponent() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

  return (
    <Search
      placeholder="Search here..."
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      onSearch={setSearchTerm}
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, the 'Search' component is imported from the 'Search' directory. It is then used in 'SomeComponent' with the 'placeholder' prop set to "Search here...", the 'searchTerm' prop set to the state variable 'searchTerm', and the 'onSearch' prop set to the state setter function 'setSearchTerm'. When the value of the search input field changes, 'setSearchTerm' is called with the new value, updating the 'searchTerm' state. When the 'X' icon is clicked, 'setSearchTerm' is called with an empty string, clearing the search input.
