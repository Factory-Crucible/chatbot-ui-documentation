## `components/Buttons` Directory

The `components/Buttons` directory is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the chatbot-ui project. This specific directory, `components/Buttons`, is dedicated to the definition and management of button components used across the user interface of the chatbot. The button components defined in this directory are designed to be reusable, encapsulating specific styling and functionality that can be leveraged in different parts of the application.

### Contents

The `components/Buttons` directory contains a single subdirectory named `SidebarActionButton`. This subdirectory houses two files: `index.ts` and `SidebarActionButton.tsx`.

- `SidebarActionButton`: This subdirectory contains the definition and export of the `SidebarActionButton` component. The component is a button with specific styling and functionality, designed to be used in the sidebar of the application.
- `index.ts`: This file is a module export file that simplifies import paths by re-exporting the default export from `SidebarActionButton.tsx`.
- `SidebarActionButton.tsx`: This file defines a React component named `SidebarActionButton`. The component is a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`. The `handleClick` prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the `children` prop renders any child elements within the button.

### Usage & Examples

The `SidebarActionButton` component is used in the sidebar of the chatbot-ui application. It is a button with specific styling and functionality, designed to be used in different parts of the application. The `handleClick` prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the `children` prop renders any child elements within the button.

For example, the `SidebarActionButton` might be used to create a button that opens a settings modal when clicked. The `handleClick` prop would be a function that opens the modal, and the `children` prop might be a settings icon.

```typescript
<SidebarActionButton handleClick={openSettingsModal}>
  <SettingsIcon />
</SidebarActionButton>
