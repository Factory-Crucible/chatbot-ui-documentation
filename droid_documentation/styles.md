# `styles` Directory

The `styles` directory is a crucial part of the `chatbot-ui` project, serving as the central location for defining the global styles that shape the visual aesthetics of the chatbot user interface. The directory is lean, containing only a single file, `globals.css`. This file is responsible for importing the necessary modules from the Tailwind CSS framework and defining custom styles that are applied across the entire project.

## Contents

The `styles` directory is composed of a single file:

- `globals.css`: This is a CSS file that holds the global styles for the project. It imports base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework and includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. The file also sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade. It contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Additionally, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

## Key Components

The `globals.css` file is the key component of the `styles` directory. It is responsible for the global styling of the project, ensuring a consistent look and feel across all components and pages. The file leverages the utility-first CSS framework, Tailwind CSS, to provide a wide range of styling options. It also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar and the HTML document's background color. The file's media query and padding removal for certain 'pre' elements demonstrate its role in responsive design and fine-tuning the project's layout.

## Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file is used to apply global styles to the `chatbot-ui` project. It is automatically loaded by the Next.js framework, ensuring that the defined styles are applied across all pages and components of the project.

For example, the file sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade, providing a consistent backdrop for the chatbot interface. It also includes a media query that adjusts the width of 'pre' elements for screens with a maximum width of 720px, ensuring that the layout remains responsive and user-friendly on smaller screens.

The file also demonstrates its role in enhancing the user interface by defining custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. This includes different styles for the scrollbar's track, thumb, and corner, as well as hover states, providing a more visually appealing and interactive scrollbar for users.

Lastly, the file removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'. This fine-tuning of the layout helps to ensure that code blocks are displayed correctly and without unnecessary padding, enhancing the readability of code snippets within the chatbot interface.
