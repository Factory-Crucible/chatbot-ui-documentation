## components/Mobile

The `components/Mobile` directory is dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot user interface. It is a crucial part of the codebase as it ensures the chatbot UI is responsive and user-friendly on mobile devices. The directory currently contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component for the mobile application's navigation bar. This component is specifically designed to handle the navigation needs of the chatbot application on mobile devices.

### Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is structured simply, containing only one file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines the `Navbar` functional component. This component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of the chatbot application when accessed from a mobile device. It accepts two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`. The `selectedConversation` prop is an object of type `Conversation` representing the currently active chat, while the `onNewConversation` prop is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started.

### Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the `Navbar` functional component, which is a critical part of the mobile user interface. This component manages the display of the currently active conversation and the initiation of new conversations in the chatbot application. It does this by accepting and utilizing two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`.

### Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the chatbot application to manage and display the navigation bar on mobile devices. It is designed to display the name of the currently active conversation and provide a way to initiate new conversations.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object of type `Conversation` representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. When the `IconPlus` button within the `Navbar` component is clicked, it triggers the `handleNewConversation` function, initiating a new conversation.
