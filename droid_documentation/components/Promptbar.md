## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains the `Promptbar` component and its related files and subcomponents. The `Promptbar` component represents a sidebar in the user interface of the application, providing functions for managing prompts and folders. The directory includes an entry point file `index.ts`, a context file `PromptBar.context.tsx`, the main component file `Promptbar.tsx`, and a state file `Promptbar.state.tsx`. It also contains a subdirectory `components/Promptbar/components` which houses related components.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains the following files and subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: Serves as the entry point for the `Promptbar` component.
- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: Defines the context for the `Promptbar` component, including state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: The main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: Defines the initial state and interface for the `Promptbar` component.
- `components/Promptbar/components`: A subdirectory containing related components.

### Key Components

The `components/Promptbar` directory includes several critical files:

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This context file outlines the shape of the context, including the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This main component file uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects. It imports several other components and a context for state management.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This state file outlines the structure of the initial state for the `Promptbar` component, including a `searchTerm` of type string and `filteredPrompts` which is an array of `Prompt` objects.

### Usage & Examples

The `Promptbar` component is used within the application to manage prompts and folders. It provides functions for toggling the prompt bar, creating, deleting, and updating prompts, and handling the dropping of prompts into folders. The `Promptbar` component uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization and the `useCreateReducer` hook for state management.

The `Promptbar` component is imported in other parts of the application using the entry point file `index.ts`. This allows other files to import the `Promptbar` component directly from the `Promptbar` directory, rather than having to specify the `Promptbar.tsx` file.

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is used to provide a context for the `Promptbar` component. This context includes the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts. This context is then used in other parts of the application to manage the state and behavior of the `Promptbar` component.

The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file is used to define the initial state and interface for the `Promptbar` component. This includes a `searchTerm` of type string and `filteredPrompts` which is an array of `Prompt` objects. This state is then used in the `Promptbar` component to manage the state of the `Promptbar`.
