# Directory Overview: components

The `components` directory is a central part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. It houses the React components that collectively form the user interface of the chatbot. Each subdirectory within `components` corresponds to a specific part of the chatbot UI, such as the Sidebar, Settings, Buttons, Chatbar, Chat, Markdown, Folder, Spinner, Promptbar, Search, and Mobile components. These components are responsible for various functionalities of the chatbot, from rendering markdown content and managing settings to handling chat conversations and providing search functionality.

## Contents

The `components` directory is a collection of subdirectories, each dedicated to a specific component of the chatbot UI. For instance, the `components/Markdown` directory handles markdown rendering within the chatbot UI, enhancing the user experience by providing a visually appealing and efficient way to display markdown content and code snippets. The `components/Buttons` directory contains the code for the SidebarActionButton, a button with specific styling and functionality that is a key part of the user interface. The `components/Search` directory handles the search functionality within the user interface, rendering a search input field and managing the search functionality.

The `components/Promptbar` directory serves as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application, a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. The `components/Folder` directory is dedicated to the `Folder` component, representing a folder in a file system. The `components/Mobile` directory is dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot user interface.
