## `components/Folder` Directory

The `components/Folder` directory is a part of the `chatbot-ui` project's component structure, specifically designed to handle the representation and interaction of a folder in a file system within the user interface. This directory contains two main files, `index.ts` and `Folder.tsx`, each playing a significant role in the functionality of the folder component. The `Folder.tsx` file is a React component that encapsulates the logic and rendering of a folder, while the `index.ts` file simplifies the import process of this component into other parts of the codebase.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory is composed of two TypeScript files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. The `Folder` component is responsible for rendering a folder in a file system and handling user interactions such as renaming, deleting, and drag and drop events. It also maintains the state of the folder, including its open/closed status and its name during a renaming operation.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as a gateway for importing the `Folder` component from the `Folder.tsx` file. By exporting the default export from `Folder.tsx`, it simplifies the import process, allowing other files to import the `Folder` component directly from `index.ts`.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It exports the `Folder` component, which is a crucial part of the user interface. This component represents a folder in a file system, providing an interactive element for users to manage their folders. It accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. The component maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the `chatbot-ui` project to represent a folder in a file system. It is a reusable component that can be utilized wherever a folder representation is needed. The component accepts several props to customize its behavior and appearance based on the current state of the application.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Folder` component might be used:

```typescript
import Folder from '../components/Folder';

// ...

<Folder
  currentFolder={currentFolder}
  searchTerm={searchTerm}
  handleDrop={handleDrop}
  folderComponent={folderComponent}
/>
```

In this example, `currentFolder` is the folder that the `Folder` component represents, `searchTerm` is a string that could be used to filter the contents of the folder, `handleDrop` is a function that handles a drag and drop event, and `folderComponent` is a list of React elements that represent the contents of the folder.
