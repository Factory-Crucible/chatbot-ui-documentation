## Hooks Directory

The `hooks` directory is a specialized section of the codebase that houses custom React hooks. These hooks are designed to encapsulate logic related to state management and HTTP requests, providing a reusable and efficient way to handle these operations across the application. The directory contains two TypeScript files: `useCreateReducer.ts` and `useFetch.ts`. Each of these files exports a custom hook that is designed to perform a specific function within the application.

### Contents

The `hooks` directory is composed of two TypeScript files:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useCreateReducer`. The hook is designed to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. It also defines two TypeScript types: `FieldNames` and `ActionType` which are used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.

- `useFetch.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook for making HTTP requests. It defines two types, `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel`, to structure the request parameters. The `useFetch` hook returns an object with methods for each HTTP verb (get, post, put, patch, delete). Each method uses a helper function `handleFetch` to perform the actual fetch operation.

### Key Components

The `hooks` directory contains two key components:

- `useCreateReducer`: This custom hook is a critical part of the state management strategy in the application. It provides a typed reducer with dispatch and state, allowing for robust and type-safe state management. The `FieldNames` and `ActionType` types defined in this file are integral to the functioning of the `useCreateReducer` hook, as they provide the structure for the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.

- `useFetch`: This custom hook is responsible for making HTTP requests within the application. It provides a structured and reusable way to make requests and handle responses, including error handling. The `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel` types defined in this file provide the structure for the request parameters, ensuring that requests are well-formed and consistent across the application.

### Usage & Examples

The hooks defined in this directory are used throughout the application to manage state and make HTTP requests.

The `useCreateReducer` hook is used to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. It is typically used in components that require complex state management. For example, a component that manages a form with multiple fields might use `useCreateReducer` to manage the form state.

The `useFetch` hook is used to make HTTP requests. It is typically used in components that need to fetch data from an API. For example, a component that displays a list of items fetched from an API might use `useFetch` to make the request and handle the response.

Please note that the above examples are illustrative and not actual code snippets. The actual usage of these hooks may vary depending on the specific requirements of the components in which they are used.
