## components/Spinner

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The Spinner component is a crucial part of the user experience, providing users with a visual cue that the application is processing data or waiting for a response.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. The component accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop controls the dimensions of the spinner, while the 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner. The spinner is created using SVG and includes an animation for the spinning effect.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component, exporting the default export from 'Spinner.tsx'. This setup simplifies imports elsewhere in the project, as the Spinner component can be imported directly from 'components/Spinner' without specifying the 'Spinner.tsx' file.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the Spinner component, defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file. This component is a critical part of the user interface, providing a visual indication of loading states. The Spinner component is versatile, with its size and additional CSS classes customizable through props. This flexibility allows the Spinner component to be used in various parts of the application, adapting to different contexts and styles.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate loading states. For instance, it may be displayed while the application is waiting for a response from an API request, or while data is being processed.

Here is a simplified example of how the Spinner component might be used in a React component:

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

const LoadingComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Loading data...</p>
      <Spinner size="2em" className="text-blue-500" />
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the Spinner component is imported from 'components/Spinner' and used in a 'LoadingComponent'. The 'size' prop is set to '2em', making the spinner larger than its default size, and the 'className' prop is set to 'text-blue-500', applying a blue color to the spinner through a Tailwind CSS utility class.
