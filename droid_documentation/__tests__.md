# `__tests__` Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the `chatbot-ui` project. It is a crucial part of the codebase, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the code. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within `utils`, there's another subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains one subdirectory, `utils`. This subdirectory is a testing suite for the utility functions within the application. It contains a subdirectory named `app`, which houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.

### `__tests__/utils`

The `__tests__/utils` directory is a testing suite for utility functions within the application. It contains a subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations. This file ensures that exported objects align with the expected format for each version and tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one. The test checks that the updated data matches the expected structure of the current format.

### `__tests__/utils/app`

The directory `__tests__/utils/app` contains test files for the application's utility functions. Specifically, it includes a file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file tests utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It verifies different versions of the export format, ensuring that a given object matches the expected format for each version. The file also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest one, and checks that the cleaned data aligns with the expected structure of the latest format.

### `__tests__/utils/app/importExports.test.ts`

This is a test file for utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It imports several functions and types from the application's utility and types directories. The file contains tests for different versions of the export format, checking whether a given object matches the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest format. The tests ensure that the cleaned data matches the expected structure of the latest format.

## Key Components

The key component in the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file. This file tests the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the exported objects conform to the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one. This file is crucial as it validates the data integrity and compatibility of the application across different versions.

## Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used for testing the application's utility functions. The `importExports.test.ts` file, for example, tests the import and export operations of the application. It verifies that a given object matches the expected format for each version and that the `cleanData` function correctly updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

Here is a simplified example of how the tests in `importExports.test.ts` might be structured:

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {
    it('should return true for v1 format', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
    it('should return false for non-v1 formats', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
  });
  // Similar tests for other versions...
  describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
    describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {
      it('should return the latest format', () => {
        // Test code here
      });
    });
    // Similar tests for other versions...
  });
});
```

This example shows how the tests are organized into different `describe` blocks for each function, with individual `it` blocks for each test case. This structure makes it easy to understand what each test is doing and to add new tests as needed.
