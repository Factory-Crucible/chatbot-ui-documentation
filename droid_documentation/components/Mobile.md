# `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot user interface. It is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project responsible for specific parts of the user interface and functionality of the chatbot. The `components/Mobile` directory currently contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component named 'Navbar'. This component is specifically designed for the mobile application's navigation bar and plays a crucial role in the mobile user interface of the chatbot.

## Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is a simple structure with a single file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines the 'Navbar' component for the mobile application. The component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of a chat application.

## Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines a functional component named 'Navbar' that is used in the navigation bar of the mobile version of the chat application. The 'Navbar' component accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The 'selectedConversation' prop is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat. The 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

## Usage & Examples

The 'Navbar' component defined in the `Navbar.tsx` file is used within the mobile version of the chatbot application. It is a part of the navigation bar and plays a crucial role in managing the chat conversations. The component accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The 'selectedConversation' prop represents the currently active chat, while the 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated.

Here is a simplified example of how the 'Navbar' component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started.
