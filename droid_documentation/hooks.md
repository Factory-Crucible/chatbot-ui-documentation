# Hooks Directory Documentation

The `hooks` directory is a critical part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It is dedicated to housing custom React hooks, which are reusable stateful logic functions. These hooks are used across the application to manage state and side effects, and to encapsulate complex logic into easy-to-use interfaces. The hooks in this directory are written in TypeScript, providing static typing to ensure reliability and ease of refactoring.

## Contents

The `hooks` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useCreateReducer` and two TypeScript types, `FieldNames` and `ActionType`. The `useCreateReducer` hook is designed to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state, taking an object with an `initialState` property as an argument. The `FieldNames` type extracts property names from the initial state of the reducer, while `ActionType` defines the action type for the dispatch object.

- `useFetch.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named `useFetch` and two TypeScript types, `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel`. The `useFetch` hook provides methods for making HTTP requests, each corresponding to an HTTP verb (get, post, put, patch, delete). The `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel` types structure the request parameters. The `useFetch` hook uses a helper function `handleFetch` to perform the actual fetch operation, handling the response based on its content type and throwing errors for further handling.

## Key Components

The `useCreateReducer.ts` and `useFetch.ts` files are the key components of the `hooks` directory. 

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: The `useCreateReducer` hook is a critical part of the application's state management. It provides a typed interface for creating reducers, which are used to manage complex state transitions in the application. The `FieldNames` and `ActionType` types ensure that the reducer's initial state and dispatch actions are correctly typed, improving the reliability and maintainability of the code.

- `useFetch.ts`: The `useFetch` hook is a central part of the application's interaction with external APIs. It provides a unified interface for making HTTP requests, encapsulating the complexity of fetch operations into simple method calls. The `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel` types structure the request parameters, ensuring that all requests are correctly formed. The `handleFetch` helper function handles the response and error handling, improving the robustness of the application's API interactions.

## Usage & Examples

The hooks defined in the `hooks` directory are used throughout the application to manage state and side effects, and to interact with external APIs.

- `useCreateReducer`: This hook is used to create reducers for managing complex state transitions. For example, it could be used to manage the state of a form, with each form field corresponding to a property in the reducer's state, and each action corresponding to a form field update.

- `useFetch`: This hook is used to make HTTP requests to external APIs. For example, it could be used to fetch data from the OpenAI API for chat functionality, or from Google APIs for search functionality. The `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, and `delete` methods correspond to the respective HTTP verbs, and can be used to make requests as needed.

Please note that the above examples are illustrative and may not represent the actual usage patterns in the codebase. Always refer to the codebase for the most accurate and up-to-date usage examples.
