## components/Sidebar

The `components/Sidebar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It houses the TypeScript files that define the Sidebar component and its functionalities. The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The directory also includes a subdirectory, `components/Sidebar/components`, which contains additional component files for managing the sidebar.

### Contents

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point, exporting the main Sidebar component from 'Sidebar.tsx'.
- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `components/Sidebar/components`: This subdirectory contains additional component files for managing the sidebar, including 'OpenCloseButton.tsx', which exports two components responsible for opening and closing the sidebar.

### Key Components

- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file is the heart of the Sidebar directory. It defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. This component is used extensively within the Sidebar component to create interactive elements.
- `components/Sidebar/components/OpenCloseButton.tsx`: This file exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are responsible for opening and closing the sidebar, and their appearance changes based on the screen size.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `components/Sidebar` directory are used to manage the sidebar of the chatbot UI. The Sidebar component, defined in `Sidebar.tsx`, is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization.

The `SidebarButton.tsx` file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. This component is used extensively within the Sidebar component to create interactive elements.

The `components/Sidebar/components/OpenCloseButton.tsx` file exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are responsible for opening and closing the sidebar, and their appearance changes based on the screen size.

For example, the `CloseSidebarButton` and `OpenSidebarButton` components might be used like this:

```typescript
<CloseSidebarButton onClick={handleClose} side="left" />
<OpenSidebarButton onClick={handleOpen} side="right" />
```

In this example, `handleClose` and `handleOpen` are functions that handle closing and opening the sidebar, respectively. The `side` prop indicates the side of the screen where the sidebar is located.
