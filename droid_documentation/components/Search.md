## `components/Search` Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the home for the Search component. This component is a functional React component written in TypeScript, designed to provide a search input field for the user interface. The Search component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' represents the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input when clicked. The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `Search.tsx`: This file exports a functional React component named 'Search'. The component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' represents the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input when clicked.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the directory, exporting the default from 'Search.tsx'. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Search.tsx` file. This file exports a functional React component named 'Search' that is used throughout the chatbot-ui project. The 'Search' component is responsible for rendering the search input field in the user interface, handling user input, and updating the search term. It also provides functionality to clear the search input.

The `index.ts` file, while not complex in its implementation, plays a crucial role in the directory structure. It exports the default export from 'Search.tsx', serving as the public interface for the 'Search' directory. This allows other parts of the code to import the 'Search' component easily.

### Usage & Examples

The 'Search' component is used in the chatbot-ui project to provide a search input field in the user interface. It is imported from the 'Search' directory and used in various parts of the project where search functionality is required.

The 'Search' component is used as follows:

```typescript
import Search from 'components/Search';

// ...

<Search
  placeholder="Search..."
  searchTerm={searchTerm}
  onSearch={handleSearch}
/>
```

In this example, `searchTerm` is a state variable representing the current search term, and `handleSearch` is a function that updates this state variable. The 'Search' component displays the `searchTerm` in the input field and calls `handleSearch` when the value of the input field changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling `handleSearch` with an empty string.
