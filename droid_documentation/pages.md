## Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a fundamental part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It serves as the primary location for the application's main entry points and API routes. The directory contains key files and a subdirectory that handle the home page, custom Document and App components for the Next.js application, and API requests and responses. The files and subdirectory within the `pages` directory work together to provide the necessary functionality for the application's user interface, server-side rendering, and API interactions.

### Contents

The `pages` directory consists of three TypeScript files and an `api` subdirectory. 

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.

- `api`: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

The `pages` directory contains several critical files and a subdirectory that contribute significantly to the functionality of the application.

- `index.tsx`: This file is crucial as it serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, which are essential for rendering the home page and its data.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines the HTML document structure, which is critical for the correct rendering and functionality of the application.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It plays a vital role in setting up the application and ensuring its smooth operation.

- `api`: This subdirectory is key as it contains files that handle API requests and responses, which are crucial for the application's interaction with OpenAI and Google APIs.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectory within the `pages` directory are used to handle the main entry points of the application, server-side rendering, and API interactions.

- `index.tsx`: This file is used as the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory.

```typescript
export { default, getServerSideProps } from './api/home';
```

- `_document.tsx`: This file is used to define a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

```typescript
type Props = DocumentProps & {};
export default function Document(props: Props) {}
```

- `_app.tsx`: This file is used to initialize pages and set up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.

```typescript
function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps<{}>)
```

- `api`: This subdirectory is used to handle API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application. For example, the `chat.ts` file in the `api` subdirectory serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality.

```typescript
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};

const handler = async (req: Request): Promise<Response> => {
};

export default handler;
```
