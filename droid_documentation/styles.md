## Styles Directory

The Styles directory is dedicated to the global styling of the project. It houses a single file, 'globals.css', which is responsible for defining the overall look and feel of the application. This file integrates the Tailwind CSS framework and custom styles to create a consistent and appealing user interface.

### Contents

The Styles directory contains one file:

- `globals.css`: This file is a CSS file that contains global styles for the project. It integrates base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework and includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. The file also sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade. It contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Additionally, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `globals.css` file. This file is responsible for the global styling of the project. It sets the stage for the visual presentation of the application, defining the base styles, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework. It also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar and the HTML document's background color. The file contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. It also removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file is used to define the global styles for the project. It is loaded by the Next.js application and applied to the entire project. The styles defined in this file are applied to every page and component in the application, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the entire project.

For example, the file sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade. This means that every page in the application will have a dark background color. Similarly, the file includes a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. This ensures that 'pre' elements are displayed correctly on smaller screens.
