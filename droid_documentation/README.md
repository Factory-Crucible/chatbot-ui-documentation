Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the repository, including its purpose, technologies used, major components, conventions, structure, main flows, and testing principles. These docs are generated and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes by the Documentation Droid.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to facilitate the development of a chatbot user interface (UI). This repository is a part of a larger system, where it plays a crucial role in providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for chatbot interactions. It interacts with other services, such as OpenAI and Google APIs, to generate prompts and send responses.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies. It is a Docker-based Node.js project that uses TypeScript for static typing. The project uses React for building the UI and Next.js for server-side rendering. It also uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Kubernetes for container orchestration.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components. The 'pages' directory serves as one of the entry points to the codebase, containing key files for the home page and API requests. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different part of the UI. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project, such as server-side operations and rate limiting. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants used throughout the project.

### Conventions

The codebase follows certain conventions. File naming follows the pattern of using lowercase letters and separating words with periods, such as 'chat.ts' or 'openai.ts'. Directories are named in lowercase letters, with words separated by hyphens, such as 'chatbot-ui'. The '__tests__' directory is used for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory serving as a testing suite.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. Some directories contain a lot of code, while others contain static assets and are rarely utilized. The root directory contains configuration files for the project, Docker, and various tools like Makefile, Prettier, PostCSS, and Tailwind CSS. It also includes a Dockerfile for creating a Docker image and a 'docker-compose.yml' for defining and managing the Docker application. The 'package.json' file lists the project's dependencies and scripts. The 'public' directory contains branding files and a 'screenshots' subdirectory. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The '__tests__' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the chatbot UI. The 'pages' directory serves as the entry point, with 'index.tsx' rendering the home page and '_app.tsx' initializing pages and setting up libraries. The 'components' directory contains various parts of the UI, with each subdirectory representing a different component. The 'utils' directory provides utility functions for different aspects of the project, such as managing chat conversations and making API calls. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. For a more in-depth understanding of these flows, refer to the respective documentation files in the directory, such as [`pages.md`](./pages.md), [`components/README.md`](./components/README.md), [`utils.md`](./utils.md), and [`services.md`](./services.md).

### System Connections

The codebase interacts with external systems, specifically the OpenAI and Google APIs. The 'pages/api' directory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with these APIs to generate prompts and send responses. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and making API calls. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations for deploying the application. For more information on these interactions, refer to the respective documentation files, such as [`pages/api/home/index.ts`](./pages/api/home/index.ts), [`services.md`](./services.md), and [`k8s.md`](./k8s.md).

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows certain testing principles. The '__tests__' directory is dedicated to testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory serving as a testing suite. The 'importExports.test.ts' file validates the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. It also tests a function named 'cleanData', which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. For more information on testing, refer to the [`__tests__.md`](./__tests__.md) file.
