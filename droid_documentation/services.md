## Services Directory

The `services` directory plays a crucial role in the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses two TypeScript files, `errorService.ts` and `useApiService.ts`, which define custom React hooks that are integral to the functioning of the chatbot UI. These hooks are responsible for providing localized error messages and making API calls, respectively. The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Contents

The `services` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named `useErrorService` that leverages the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next` to provide localized error messages. The hook returns a function `getModelsError` that takes an error object and returns an `ErrorMessage` object with a title, status code, and list of messages.
- `useApiService.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useApiService` that uses another custom hook `useFetch` to make API calls. The hook provides a function `getModels` which makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint. The function accepts an object of type `GetModelsRequestProps` and an optional `AbortSignal` as parameters.

### Key Components

The `services` directory contains two key TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: The `useErrorService` hook defined in this file is crucial for providing localized error messages. It returns a function `getModelsError` that takes an error object and returns an `ErrorMessage` object. This object contains a title, status code, and list of messages, which are translated using the `useTranslation` hook. This functionality is essential for providing user-friendly error messages in the chatbot UI.
- `useApiService.ts`: The `useApiService` hook defined in this file is responsible for making API calls. It provides a function `getModels` which makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint. This function is used throughout the codebase to fetch models from the API, making it a key component of the chatbot UI's functionality.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `services` directory are used throughout the codebase to provide localized error messages and make API calls.

- `errorService.ts`: The `useErrorService` hook is used in components that need to display error messages. For example, a component might use this hook to get an error message when an API call fails. The `getModelsError` function can be used to get an `ErrorMessage` object from an error object.
- `useApiService.ts`: The `useApiService` hook is used in components that need to make API calls. For example, a component might use this hook to fetch models from the `/api/models` endpoint. The `getModels` function can be used to make a POST request to this endpoint with a `GetModelsRequestProps` object and an optional `AbortSignal`.
