## Types Directory

The `types` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It contains TypeScript files that define various interfaces, types, and constants used throughout the project. These definitions provide a consistent structure for data and ensure type safety, which is a key feature of TypeScript. The types defined in this directory are used in various parts of the application, from the chat system and plugins to settings and storage. They also structure data related to external services like Google and OpenAI.

### Contents

The `types` directory contains several TypeScript files, each serving a specific purpose:

- `data.ts`: Defines a key-value pair structure.
- `prompt.ts`: Outlines a prompt object.
- `plugin.ts`: Defines structures for plugins.
- `settings.ts`: Defines theme settings.
- `storage.ts`: Defines the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.
- `openai.ts`: Defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers.
- `chat.ts`: Defines structures for a chat system.
- `export.ts`: Relates to the application's export functionality.
- `google.ts`: Structures data related to Google's services.
- `folder.ts`: Defines a 'Folder' object.
- `index.ts`: An empty placeholder file.
- `error.ts`: Structures error messages.
- `env.ts`: Represents environment variables for the OpenAI API.

### Key Components

The `types` directory contains several key components that are critical to the functioning of the chatbot UI:

- `plugin.ts`: This file defines the structure and data for plugins in the application. It is crucial as it provides a consistent structure for plugins, which are a key feature of the chatbot UI.

- `storage.ts`: This file defines the local storage schema for the chatbot UI. It is important as it ensures that the local storage data is consistently structured across the application.

- `openai.ts`: This file defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers. It is critical as it structures the data related to the OpenAI API, which is a key external service used by the chatbot UI.

- `chat.ts`: This file defines various interfaces and types related to a chat system. It is crucial as it provides a consistent structure for chat data across the application.

### Usage & Examples

The types defined in this directory are used throughout the codebase. For instance, the `KeyValuePair` interface defined in `data.ts` is likely used wherever a key-value pair structure is needed. Similarly, the `Prompt` interface defined in `prompt.ts` is used to provide a consistent structure for prompt objects throughout the codebase.

The `Settings` interface defined in `settings.ts` is used across the application to ensure consistent usage of the theme settings. The `LocalStorage` interface defined in `storage.ts` is used to structure the local storage data for the chatbot UI.

The `OpenAIModel` interface and `OpenAIModelID` enumeration defined in `openai.ts` are used to structure the data related to the OpenAI API. The `Message`, `Role`, `ChatBody`, and `Conversation` interfaces defined in `chat.ts` are used to structure the chat data in the application.

The `SupportedExportFormats` type and `ExportFormatV1`, `ExportFormatV2`, `ExportFormatV3`, and `ExportFormatV4` interfaces defined in `export.ts` are used to structure the data related to the export functionality of the application.

The `GoogleBody`, `GoogleResponse`, and `GoogleSource` interfaces defined in `google.ts` are used to structure the data related to Google's services.

The `FolderInterface` and `FolderType` defined in `folder.ts` are used to structure the 'Folder' objects in the application.

The `ProcessEnv` interface defined in `env.ts` is used to structure the environment variables related to the OpenAI API.

The `ErrorMessage` interface defined in `error.ts` is used to structure the error messages in the application.
