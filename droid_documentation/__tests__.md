## **tests** Directory

The `__tests__` directory is the designated location for all testing related files and subdirectories in the project. It houses a subdirectory named `utils` which contains tests for the utility functions of the application. Within `utils`, there is a subdirectory named `app` that contains a test file `importExports.test.ts`. This file tests the import and export operations of the application, ensuring the exported objects conform to the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one, ensuring the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

### Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains one subdirectory:

- `utils`: This subdirectory serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. It contains a subdirectory named `app` which houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.

### Key Components

- `importExports.test.ts`: This file tests the import and export operations of the application, ensuring the exported objects conform to the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

### Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to store and organize all test files and subdirectories related to the application. The `importExports.test.ts` file, for instance, tests the import and export operations of the application. It verifies different versions of the export format, ensuring that a given object matches the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest one, and checks that the cleaned data aligns with the expected structure of the latest format.
