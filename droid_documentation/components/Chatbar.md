## components/Chatbar

The `components/Chatbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It is responsible for managing the chat bar's state, context, and various actions such as changing API keys, managing conversations, and handling plugin keys. The directory contains three TypeScript files and a subdirectory named `components`. The TypeScript files define the initial state, the main React component, and the context for the Chatbar component. The `components` subdirectory contains six TypeScript files, each exporting a React component used in the chatbot UI. These components handle settings, conversations, chat folders, and plugin keys.

### Contents

The `components/Chatbar` directory contains three TypeScript files and one subdirectory:

- `Chatbar.state.tsx`: This file sets the initial state for the Chatbar component, including a search term and a list of filtered conversations.
- `Chatbar.tsx`: This file is a React component representing the chat bar, with handlers for various actions like changing API keys and managing conversations.
- `Chatbar.context.tsx`: This file defines the context for the Chatbar component, including the state, dispatch function, and several handler functions.
- `components`: This subdirectory contains six TypeScript files, each exporting a React component used in the chatbot UI.

### Key Components

The `Chatbar.tsx` file is a critical component in this directory. It is a React component that represents the chat bar of the chatbot application. It defines several handlers for different actions such as changing API keys, handling plugin keys, exporting and importing data, clearing conversations, deleting conversations, and toggling the chat bar. These handlers interact with both local and global state, and also make use of local storage.

The `Chatbar.context.tsx` file is another key component. It defines the context for the Chatbar component, including the state, dispatch function, and several handler functions for managing conversations, exporting and importing data, and handling changes to plugin keys and API keys.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `components/Chatbar` directory are used to manage the chat bar's state and context in the chatbot UI. The `Chatbar.state.tsx` file sets the initial state for the Chatbar component, including a search term and a list of filtered conversations. The `Chatbar.tsx` file is a React component that uses several hooks for state and context management. It defines several handlers for different actions such as changing API keys, handling plugin keys, exporting and importing data, clearing conversations, deleting conversations, and toggling the chat bar.

The `Chatbar.context.tsx` file defines the context for the Chatbar component, including the state, dispatch function, and several handler functions. This context is then used in other components to manage conversations, export and import data, and handle changes to plugin keys and API keys.

The `components` subdirectory contains six TypeScript files, each exporting a React component used in the chatbot UI. These components handle settings, conversations, chat folders, and plugin keys. For example, the `ChatbarSettings.tsx` file provides the settings interface for the chatbar, including options to clear conversations, import/export data, and change API keys. The `Conversations.tsx` file displays a list of individual conversations not part of any folder.
