## components/Folder

The `components/Folder` directory is dedicated to the `Folder` React component, which represents a folder in a file system. This component is responsible for rendering a button and an input field, and includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The `Folder` component is a crucial part of the user interface, enabling users to interact with folders in the chatbot UI.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two files:

- `Folder.tsx`: A React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. This component represents a folder in a file system, and includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.
- `index.ts`: A TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

### Key Components

- `Folder.tsx`: This file is the heart of the `components/Folder` directory. It exports the `Folder` component, which is responsible for rendering a folder in the file system. The `Folder` component accepts several props, maintains state, and includes handlers for various user interactions.
- `index.ts`: This file simplifies the import process from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects that enhances code readability and maintainability.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used throughout the codebase to represent a folder in a file system. It accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. The component maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Folder` component might be used:

```typescript
import Folder from './components/Folder';

const App = () => {
  const handleDrop = (e, folder) => {
    // Handle drop event
  };

  return (
    <Folder
      currentFolder={currentFolder}
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      handleDrop={handleDrop}
      folderComponent={folderComponent}
    />
  );
};
```

Please note that this is a simplified example and may not represent the full complexity of the `Folder` component's usage in the actual codebase.
