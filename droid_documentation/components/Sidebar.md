## components/Sidebar

The `components/Sidebar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It contains TypeScript files that define the Sidebar component and its functionalities. The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The directory also includes a 'components' subdirectory, which houses additional component files for managing the sidebar.

### Contents

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point, exporting the main Sidebar component from 'Sidebar.tsx'.
- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior.
- `components`: This subdirectory contains additional component files for managing the sidebar, including 'OpenCloseButton.tsx', which exports two components responsible for opening and closing the sidebar.

### Key Components

The key components in the `components/Sidebar` directory include:

- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `components/OpenCloseButton.tsx`: This file exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are responsible for opening and closing the sidebar, respectively.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories in the `components/Sidebar` directory are used to manage the sidebar in the chatbot UI. The Sidebar component, defined in 'Sidebar.tsx', is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization.

The 'SidebarButton.tsx' file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. The 'text' prop is a string that represents the button's label, the 'icon' prop is a JSX.Element that represents the button's icon, and the 'onClick' prop is a function that is executed when the button is clicked.

The 'components/OpenCloseButton.tsx' file exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are used to open and close the sidebar in a user interface. Both components accept two props: 'onClick', a function that is triggered when the button is clicked, and 'side', a string that can be either 'left' or 'right', indicating the side of the screen where the sidebar is located.

For example, the 'CloseSidebarButton' component might be used like this:

```typescript
<CloseSidebarButton onClick={handleClose} side="left" />
```

In this example, `handleClose` is a function that is executed when the 'CloseSidebarButton' is clicked, and the 'side' prop is set to 'left', indicating that the sidebar is located on the left side of the screen.
