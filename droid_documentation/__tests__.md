# `__tests__` Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation project. It is a crucial part of the project's engineering practices, ensuring the reliability and maintainability of the codebase. The directory is structured to reflect the organization of the project's codebase, with a focus on testing the utility functions of the application. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains one subdirectory:

- `utils`: This subdirectory is a testing suite for the utility functions within the application. It contains another subdirectory named `app`, which houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.

### `__tests__/utils` Directory

The `__tests__/utils` directory is a testing suite for utility functions within the application. It is designed to ensure the correct functionality of the utility functions that are critical to the operation of the application. The directory contains a subdirectory named `app`, which houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.

#### `__tests__/utils/app` Directory

The `__tests__/utils/app` directory contains test files for the application's utility functions. It includes a file named `importExports.test.ts`, which tests utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. The directory is designed to ensure that the utility functions related to data import and export are working as expected.

##### `__tests__/utils/app/importExports.test.ts` File

The `importExports.test.ts` file is a test file for utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It contains tests for different versions of the export format, checking whether a given object matches the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest format.

## Key Components

The key component in the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file located in the `__tests__/utils/app` subdirectory. This file tests the utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It verifies different versions of the export format, ensuring that a given object matches the expected format for each version. The file also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest one, and checks that the cleaned data aligns with the expected structure of the latest format.

## Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to test the utility functions of the application. For example, the `importExports.test.ts` file tests the `cleanData` function, which is used to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The tests in this file ensure that the cleaned data matches the expected structure of the latest format.

The skeleton of the `importExports.test.ts` file is as follows:

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {});
it('should return true for v1 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v1 formats', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV2', () => {});
it('should return true for v2 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v2 formats', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV3', () => {});
it('should return true for v3 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v3 formats', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV4', () => {});
it('should return true for v4 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v4 formats', () => {});
describe('cleanData Functions', () => {});
describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {});
it('should return the latest format', () => {});
describe('cleaning v2 data', () => {});
it('should return the latest format', () => {});
describe('cleaning v4 data', () => {});
it('should return the latest format', () => {});
```

This skeleton provides a clear structure for the tests, with each test case clearly defined and organized according to the version of the export format it is testing.
