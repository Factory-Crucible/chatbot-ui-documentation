## The 'k8s' Directory: Orchestrating the Chatbot UI Application

The 'k8s' directory is the heart of the Kubernetes configurations for our chatbot UI application. It is the blueprint that outlines how the application should be deployed and managed on a Kubernetes cluster. The directory contains a single file, 'chatbot-ui.yaml', which defines the necessary Kubernetes resources for the chatbot UI application. These resources include a Namespace, a Secret, a Deployment, and a Service. Each of these resources plays a crucial role in the deployment and operation of the chatbot UI application, ensuring it runs smoothly and securely.

### Contents: The Building Blocks of the Chatbot UI Application

The 'k8s' directory is straightforward in its structure, containing only one file: 'chatbot-ui.yaml'. This file is the cornerstone of the directory, holding the entire Kubernetes configuration for the chatbot UI application.

- 'chatbot-ui.yaml': This is a Kubernetes configuration file that outlines the necessary resources for the chatbot UI application. It defines a Namespace for isolating the chatbot UI resources, a Secret for securely storing the OpenAI API key, a Deployment for detailing the Docker image, the number of replicas, and the container port, and a Service for exposing the Deployment on port 80 and routing traffic to the container port 3000.

### Key Components: The Pillars of the Chatbot UI Application

The 'chatbot-ui.yaml' file is the key component in this directory. It is a comprehensive Kubernetes configuration file that defines four critical resources for the chatbot UI application:

- Namespace 'chatbot-ui': This namespace isolates the chatbot UI resources, ensuring that they do not interfere with other resources in the Kubernetes cluster.
- Secret: This resource securely stores the OpenAI API key in a base64 encoded format, protecting it from unauthorized access.
- Deployment: This resource details the Docker image to be used, the number of replicas, and the container port. It also retrieves the OpenAI API key from the Secret, ensuring that the chatbot UI application can access the API key when needed.
- Service: This resource exposes the Deployment on port 80, routing traffic to the container port 3000. This allows the chatbot UI application to be accessible to users.

### Usage & Examples: Deploying and Managing the Chatbot UI Application

The 'chatbot-ui.yaml' file in the 'k8s' directory is used to deploy and manage the chatbot UI application on a Kubernetes cluster. When the 'chatbot-ui.yaml' file is applied to a Kubernetes cluster using the 'kubectl apply' command, the Kubernetes resources defined in the file are created in the cluster.

For example, to deploy the chatbot UI application, one would use the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f chatbot-ui.yaml
```

This command creates the Namespace, Secret, Deployment, and Service defined in the 'chatbot-ui.yaml' file, deploying the chatbot UI application to the Kubernetes cluster.

Please note that the above command is a typical usage pattern for deploying applications to a Kubernetes cluster. However, the actual usage may vary depending on the specific requirements and configurations of your Kubernetes cluster.
