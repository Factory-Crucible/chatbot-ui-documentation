- `SidebarActionButton`: This subdirectory contains the definition and export of the `SidebarActionButton` component.

The `handleClick` prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the `children` prop renders any child elements within the button.

### Key Components

The `components/Buttons` directory houses the `SidebarActionButton` component, which is a critical part of the user interface. This component is a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`. The `handleClick` prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the `children` prop renders any child elements within the button. The button's style includes a minimum width of 20px, padding of 1, and different text colors for normal and hover states.

### Usage & Examples

The `SidebarActionButton` component is used within the sidebar of the chatbot UI. It is responsible for triggering various functionalities upon user interaction. The `handleClick` prop is used to define the specific functionality that should be triggered when the button is clicked. The `children` prop is used to render any child elements within the button, allowing for flexibility in the button's content.

For example, a `SidebarActionButton` might be used to trigger the opening of a settings modal when clicked. The `handleClick` prop would be defined as a function that triggers the opening of the modal, and the `children` prop might be used to render an icon or text indicating that the button opens the settings.

```typescript
<SidebarActionButton handleClick={openSettingsModal}>
  <SettingsIcon />
</SidebarActionButton>
```

In this example, clicking the `SidebarActionButton` would trigger the `openSettingsModal` function, and the button would display a settings icon.
