## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is a part of the `integration-chatbot-ui` project's codebase. This directory is dedicated to the `Spinner` component, a functional React component that is used to display a loading spinner in the user interface. The `Spinner` component is written in TypeScript and accepts two optional props: `size` and `className`. The `size` prop determines the dimensions of the spinner, while the `className` prop allows for the addition of any extra CSS classes. The spinner is represented by an SVG element composed of multiple line elements.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an export point for the `Spinner` component. It exports the default export from the `Spinner.tsx` file. Apart from this, the file does not contain any other content.

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the `Spinner` functional component. The component accepts two optional props: `size` and `className`, which default to '1em' and an empty string respectively. The component returns an SVG element that represents a spinner, using the `size` prop for its dimensions and the `className` prop to add any additional CSS classes. The SVG is composed of multiple line elements to create the spinner's visual representation.

### Folder Structure Overview

The `components/Spinner` directory has a simple structure with no subdirectories. It contains only two files: `index.ts` and `Spinner.tsx`. The `index.ts` file is used to export the `Spinner` component, which is defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Spinner` component, which is defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file. This component is a critical part of the user interface, providing a visual indication of loading or processing activities. The `Spinner` component is exported for use in other parts of the application through the `index.ts` file.

### Usage & Examples

The `Spinner` component is used throughout the `integration-chatbot-ui` project whenever a loading spinner is required in the user interface. It can be imported from its directory and used in any React component file.

Here is an example of how the `Spinner` component might be used:

```jsx
import Spinner from '../components/Spinner';

function LoadingComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Loading data...</p>
      <Spinner size="2em" className="text-blue-500" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `Spinner` component is imported and used in a `LoadingComponent`. The `size` prop is set to '2em', making the spinner twice the default size, and the `className` prop is set to 'text-blue-500', which would apply a blue color to the spinner if using a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.
