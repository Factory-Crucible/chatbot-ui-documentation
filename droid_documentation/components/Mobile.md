It is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project, each responsible for a specific part of the user interface and functionality of the chatbot. The `components/Mobile` directory specifically contains files related to the mobile version of the application, focusing on the navigation bar functionality for the mobile chat application. 

### Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is a simple structure with no subdirectories. It contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component named 'Navbar'. This component is specifically designed for the mobile application's navigation bar.

The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button that, when clicked, triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

### Key Components
