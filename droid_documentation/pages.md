## `pages` Directory

The `pages` directory is a critical part of the `chatbot-ui` project, serving as the container for key files and subdirectories that define the structure and functionality of the application's pages. This directory is integral to the Next.js framework, which treats every file in the `pages` directory as a route in the application. The files in this directory are responsible for rendering the user interface, handling API requests, and managing the state of the application.

### Contents

The `pages` directory contains three TypeScript files and one subdirectory:

- `index.tsx`: Serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function.
- `_document.tsx`: Defines a custom Document for the Next.js application, providing an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.
- `_app.tsx`: Initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api`: A subdirectory that contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

- `index.tsx`: This file is crucial as it serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, which are imported from a sibling file in the 'api' subdirectory named 'home'.
- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, which is essential for the proper rendering and functionality of the application.
- `_app.tsx`: This file initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, making it a key component in the application's infrastructure.
- `api`: This subdirectory is vital as it contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `pages` directory are used to define the structure and functionality of the application's pages. For instance, the `index.tsx` file serves as the main entry point for the application's home page, exporting a React component and a server-side rendering function. The `_document.tsx` file defines a custom Document for the Next.js application, providing an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts. The `_app.tsx` file initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries, and also supports internationalization.

The `api` subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application. For example, the `models.ts` file handles requests related to OpenAI models, constructing URLs and fetching data from the OpenAI API. The `chat.ts` file serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality, processing requests, encoding messages, and interacting with an OpenAI service. The `google.ts` file handles API requests and responses, interacting with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API to generate prompts and send responses.

The `home` subdirectory within the `api` directory contains files related to the 'home' page of the application, including an entry point file, a main page React component, a state definition file, and a context definition file. For instance, the `home.tsx` file is a React component that serves as the main page, managing state and handling API calls. The `home.context.tsx` file defines the context for the 'home' page, outlining the 'HomeContextProps' interface and creating the 'HomeContext' using the 'createContext' function from React.
