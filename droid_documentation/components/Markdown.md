## `components/Markdown` Directory

The `components/Markdown` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to handling markdown rendering within the chatbot UI. It contains two TypeScript component files, `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx` and `CodeBlock.tsx`, which are responsible for rendering markdown content and displaying code blocks in markdown format respectively. These components are integral to the project as they enhance the user experience by providing a visually appealing and efficient way to display markdown content and code snippets.

### Contents

The `components/Markdown` directory contains the following files:

- `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx`: This TypeScript component file exports a memoized functional component named `MemoizedReactMarkdown`. The component uses the `react-markdown` library to render markdown content and optimizes performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders through memoization.

- `CodeBlock.tsx`: This TypeScript component file exports a functional component named `CodeBlock`. The component is used to display code blocks in markdown format, with syntax highlighting provided by the `react-syntax-highlighter` library. It also includes functionality to copy the code to the clipboard and download the code as a file.

### Key Components

The `components/Markdown` directory houses two key components that play a significant role in the chatbot UI's markdown rendering capabilities:

- `MemoizedReactMarkdown`: This component is crucial for rendering markdown content within the chatbot UI. It uses the `react-markdown` library to convert markdown into HTML, and leverages React's `memo` function to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the markdown content remains unchanged between renders, thereby saving computational resources.

- `CodeBlock`: This component is responsible for displaying code blocks within the markdown content. It uses the `react-syntax-highlighter` library to provide syntax highlighting, enhancing readability of the code. Additionally, it offers user-friendly features such as the ability to copy the code to the clipboard and download the code as a file, thereby improving the overall user experience.

### Usage & Examples

The components within the `components/Markdown` directory are used throughout the chatbot UI to render markdown content and display code blocks. For instance, the `MemoizedReactMarkdown` component could be used to render markdown content fetched from an API, while the `CodeBlock` component could be used to display code snippets within the markdown content.

Here's a simplified example of how these components might be used:

```typescript
import { MemoizedReactMarkdown, CodeBlock } from './components/Markdown';

// Markdown content fetched from an API
const markdownContent = "# Hello, World! \n ```javascript \n console.log('Hello, World!'); \n ```";

// Using the MemoizedReactMarkdown component to render the markdown content
<MemoizedReactMarkdown>{markdownContent}</MemoizedReactMarkdown>

// Using the CodeBlock component to display a code snippet
<CodeBlock language="javascript" value="console.log('Hello, World!');" />
```

Please note that the above code snippets are simplified examples and may not represent the exact usage within the actual codebase. Always refer to the actual codebase for accurate usage patterns.
