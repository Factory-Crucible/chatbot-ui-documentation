## `__tests__` Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a crucial part of the `integration-chatbot-ui` project, primarily dedicated to testing. It is a key component of the codebase that ensures the functionality and reliability of the application's utility functions. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing hub for the application's utility functions.

### Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains the following subdirectory:

- `utils`: This subdirectory is a testing hub for utility functions within the application. It contains a subdirectory named `app`, which houses a TypeScript test file `importExports.test.ts`.

### Folder Structure Overview

The `__tests__` directory is organized into a single subdirectory, `utils`. Within `utils`, there is another subdirectory named `app`. This `app` directory contains a TypeScript test file `importExports.test.ts`, which is specifically designed to test the import and export utility functions of the application.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file located in the `app` subdirectory of `utils`. This file tests utility functions related to import and export operations within the application. It verifies the functionality of several functions that check the version of the export format and a function that cleans data. The tests are designed to cover different scenarios to ensure the functions behave as expected.

- [`importExports.test.ts`](./__tests__/utils/app/importExports.test.ts): A TypeScript test file for utility functions related to import and export operations in the application.

### Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house tests for the application's utility functions. These tests are run using the `vitest` testing framework. The `importExports.test.ts` file, for example, contains tests for functions that check the version of the export format (`isExportFormatV1`, `isExportFormatV2`, `isExportFormatV3`, `isExportFormatV4`) and a function that cleans data (`cleanData`). Each of these functions is tested with different scenarios to ensure they behave as expected.

Example of a test case in `importExports.test.ts`:

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  // Test cases for export format functions
});

describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {
  // Test cases for isExportFormatV1 function
});

describe('isExportFormatV2', () => {
  // Test cases for isExportFormatV2 function
});

describe('isExportFormatV3', () => {
  // Test cases for isExportFormatV3 function
});

describe('isExportFormatV4', () => {
  // Test cases for isExportFormatV4 function
});

describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
  // Test cases for cleanData function
});

describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {
  // Test cases for cleaning v1 data
});

describe('cleaning v2 data', () => {
  // Test cases for cleaning v2 data
});

describe('cleaning v4 data', () => {
  // Test cases for cleaning v4 data
});
```
