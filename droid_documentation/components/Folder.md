## components/Folder

The `components/Folder` directory is dedicated to the representation and manipulation of a folder in the file system within the chatbot-ui project. It encapsulates the logic and rendering of a folder, providing functionalities such as renaming, deleting, and handling drag and drop events. The directory contains two main files: `Folder.tsx` and `index.ts`. The `Folder.tsx` file is a React component that represents a folder in the file system, while the `index.ts` file simplifies imports from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains the following files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`, which represents a folder in a file system. The component accepts several props, maintains state, and renders a button and an input field. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.
- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that exports the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file. This simplifies imports from this directory.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It exports a `Folder` component that encapsulates the logic and rendering of a folder in the file system. This component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project wherever a folder representation is needed. It accepts several props, maintains state, and includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used in the chatbot-ui project to represent a folder in the file system. It is used in various parts of the project where a folder representation is needed. For example, it may be used in a file explorer component to render a list of folders.

The `Folder` component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. Here is a simplified example of how the `Folder` component might be used:

```typescript
import Folder from './components/Folder';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const currentFolder = {...}; // some folder object
  const searchTerm = 'example';
  const handleDrop = (e, folder) => {...}; // some drop handler function
  const folderComponent = [<FolderComponent />, <FolderComponent />]; // some list of folder components

  return (
    <Folder
      currentFolder={currentFolder}
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      handleDrop={handleDrop}
      folderComponent={folderComponent}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example, the `Folder` component is imported from the `components/Folder` directory and used in a `MyComponent` component. The `Folder` component is passed several props, including a `currentFolder` object, a `searchTerm` string, a `handleDrop` function, and a `folderComponent` array.
