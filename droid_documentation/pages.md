## Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a pivotal part of the `chatbot-ui` project, serving as the container for key files and a subdirectory that are integral to the functioning of the application. This directory is responsible for defining the main entry point for the home page, customizing the Document and App components for the Next.js application, and managing the API requests and responses. The `pages` directory is structured to facilitate the efficient handling of API interactions, including those with OpenAI and Google APIs, and to support the 'home' page of the application.

### Contents

The `pages` directory is composed of three TypeScript files and an `api` subdirectory. Each file and subdirectory plays a unique role in the functioning of the application:

- `index.tsx`: This file serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from a sibling file in the `api` subdirectory named `home`.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries.

- `api` subdirectory: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

The `pages` directory houses several critical files and subdirectories that contribute to the functionality of the application:

- `index.tsx`: This file is crucial as it serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from a sibling file in the `api` subdirectory named `home`.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

- `api` subdirectory: This subdirectory is vital as it contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used in various ways within the codebase:

- `index.tsx`: This file is used as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from a sibling file in the `api` subdirectory named `home`.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is used to define a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

- `api` subdirectory: This subdirectory is used to handle API requests and responses, interact with OpenAI and Google APIs, and manage files related to the 'home' page of the application.

For example, the `index.tsx` file exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory:

```typescript
export { default, getServerSideProps } from './api/home';
```

This code snippet shows how the `index.tsx` file serves as the main entry point for the application's home page, exporting a React component and a server-side rendering function from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory.
