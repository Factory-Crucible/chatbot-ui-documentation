## `components/Folder` Directory

The `components/Folder` directory is a part of the `chatbot-ui` project's codebase that houses the logic and structure for representing a folder in the file system within the user interface. This directory contains two main files, `Folder.tsx` and `index.ts`, which work together to define and export a React component named `Folder`. This component is a key part of the project's functionality, as it provides the user with the ability to interact with folders in the chatbot's file system.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory is composed of two TypeScript files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This file defines a React component that represents a folder in a file system. The component accepts several props, maintains its own state, and renders a button and an input field. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The component uses icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package.

- `index.ts`: This file simplifies imports from the `components/Folder` directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects to simplify imports from a directory.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is a critical component in the `components/Folder` directory. It defines a `Folder` React component that represents a folder in a file system. This component is integral to the user interface of the chatbot, as it allows users to interact with folders in the chatbot's file system. The component accepts several props, maintains its own state, and includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the `chatbot-ui` project to represent a folder in the file system. It is a reusable component that can be used wherever a folder needs to be displayed in the user interface.

The `Folder` component accepts several props, including `currentFolder`, `searchTerm`, `handleDrop`, and `folderComponent`. The `currentFolder` prop is an object representing the current folder. The `searchTerm` prop is a string used for filtering the contents of the folder. The `handleDrop` prop is a function that handles drag and drop events. The `folderComponent` prop is an array of React elements representing the contents of the folder.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Folder` component might be used:

```typescript
import Folder from './components/Folder';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const currentFolder = { /* folder data */ };
  const searchTerm = '';
  const handleDrop = (e, folder) => { /* handle drop event */ };
  const folderComponent = [ /* array of folder components */ ];

  return (
    <Folder
      currentFolder={currentFolder}
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      handleDrop={handleDrop}
      folderComponent={folderComponent}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example, `MyComponent` imports the `Folder` component and uses it to display a folder in the file system. The `Folder` component is passed several props, including `currentFolder`, `searchTerm`, `handleDrop`, and `folderComponent`.
