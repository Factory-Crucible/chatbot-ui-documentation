## __tests__ Directory

The `__tests__` directory serves as a dedicated space for testing within the project. It is structured to reflect the organization of the application's codebase, with each subdirectory corresponding to a different part of the application. The directory's primary purpose is to ensure the application's functionality and integrity by validating the behavior of its various components. The tests are organized in a way that mirrors the structure of the application, making it easier to locate and understand the tests related to a specific part of the codebase.

### Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains one subdirectory: `utils`. This subdirectory is a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within the `utils` directory, there is another subdirectory named `app`, which contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`.

- `__tests__/utils`: This subdirectory is a testing suite for the application's utility functions. It contains a subdirectory named `app`.
- `__tests__/utils/app`: This subdirectory contains test files for the application's utility functions. Specifically, it includes a file named `importExports.test.ts`.

### Key Components

The key component within this directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file located in the `__tests__/utils/app` subdirectory. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

### Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house all the tests for the application. Each subdirectory within `__tests__` corresponds to a different part of the application, and the tests within each subdirectory validate the functionality of that part of the application.

For example, the `importExports.test.ts` file within the `__tests__/utils/app` subdirectory tests the import and export operations of the application. It contains several test suites, each of which is dedicated to testing a different version of the export format. Each test suite contains tests that check whether a given object matches the expected format for that version. Here's a simplified example of what these tests might look like:

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {
    it('should return true for v1 format', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
    it('should return false for non-v1 formats', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
  });
  // Similar tests for other versions...
});
```

The `importExports.test.ts` file also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest format. The tests ensure that the cleaned data matches the expected structure of the latest format. Here's a simplified example of what these tests might look like:

```typescript
describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
  describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {
    it('should return the latest format', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
  });
  // Similar tests for other versions...
});
```
