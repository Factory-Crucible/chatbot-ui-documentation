## `components/Folder` Directory

The `components/Folder` directory is a dedicated space for the `Folder` component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a representation of a folder in a file system, providing a visual and interactive element in the user interface. The `Folder` component is designed to accept several props, maintain its own state, and render a button and an input field. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The component utilizes icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package to enhance the user experience.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two main files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. The component represents a folder in a file system and includes several functionalities such as renaming, deleting, and drag and drop events.

- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

### Key Components

The `Folder` component, defined in the `Folder.tsx` file, is a critical part of the chatbot-ui project. It provides a visual representation of a folder in a file system, enhancing the user interface and user experience. The component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

The `index.ts` file, while not complex in its structure, plays a crucial role in simplifying imports from the `components/Folder` directory. By exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file, it allows other files to import from `index.ts`, which will automatically forward the import to `Folder.tsx`.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the chatbot-ui project to represent a folder in a file system. It is a versatile component that can be used in various parts of the application where a visual representation of a folder is required. The component is designed to accept several props, allowing it to be customized and reused in different contexts.

For instance, the `Folder` component can be used in a file explorer feature of the application. Here, the `currentFolder` prop can be set to the folder that the user is currently viewing, the `searchTerm` prop can be used to highlight folders that match the user's search, and the `handleDrop` prop can be used to handle files being dragged and dropped into the folder.

The `Folder` component can also be used in a settings page where users can manage their folders. Here, the `handleDrop` prop might not be needed, but the renaming and deleting handlers would be very useful.

Please note that the above examples are hypothetical and may not represent the actual usage of the `Folder` component in the chatbot-ui project. They are provided to illustrate the versatility and potential uses of the component.
