## Services Directory

The `services` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses two TypeScript files, `errorService.ts` and `useApiService.ts`, which define custom React hooks that are used throughout the project. These hooks, `useErrorService` and `useApiService`, provide functionality for handling errors and making API calls respectively. The `services` directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Contents

The `services` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named `useErrorService`. This hook uses the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next` to provide localized error messages. The hook returns an object with a `getModelsError` function. This function takes an error object as a parameter and returns an `ErrorMessage` object. The `ErrorMessage` object contains a title, a status code, and a list of messages. The title and messages are translated using the `useTranslation` hook. If the error object is null or undefined, the function returns null. If the error object does not contain a `statusText` property, the function provides a default error message.
- `useApiService.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useApiService`. This hook uses another custom hook `useFetch` to make API calls. The hook `useApiService` provides a function `getModels` which makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint. The `getModels` function accepts an object of type `GetModelsRequestProps` and an optional `AbortSignal` as parameters. The `GetModelsRequestProps` interface is also defined in this file, which expects a `key` of type string. The `getModels` function returns the result of the fetch operation. The `useApiService` hook returns an object that exposes the `getModels` function.

### Key Components

The `services` directory contains two key components:

- `useErrorService`: This custom React hook is a critical part of the error handling mechanism in the chatbot-ui project. It provides localized error messages, which enhances the user experience by providing error information in the user's preferred language. The `getModelsError` function it provides is used throughout the project to handle errors that occur when fetching models.
- `useApiService`: This custom React hook is responsible for making API calls in the chatbot-ui project. It uses the `useFetch` hook to make these calls and provides a `getModels` function that makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint. This function is used throughout the project to fetch models from the API.

### Usage & Examples

The `useErrorService` and `useApiService` hooks are used throughout the chatbot-ui project. They are imported into other files using the `import` statement and then invoked within the functional components or other hooks.

For example, the `useErrorService` hook might be used in a component like this:

```typescript
import useErrorService from '../services/errorService';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { getModelsError } = useErrorService();
  // ...
};
```

Similarly, the `useApiService` hook might be used in a component like this:

```typescript
import useApiService from '../services/useApiService';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { getModels } = useApiService();
  // ...
};
```

These examples demonstrate typical usage patterns for these hooks within the chatbot-ui project. They are invoked within functional components or other hooks, and the functions they provide are used to handle errors and make API calls.
