## `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot user interface. It is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project, including the Sidebar, Settings, Buttons, Chatbar, Chat, Markdown, Folder, Spinner, Promptbar, Search, and Mobile components. Each of these components is responsible for a specific part of the user interface and functionality of the chatbot. The `components/Mobile` directory specifically contains the `Navbar.tsx` file, which defines a functional component named 'Navbar' for the mobile application's navigation bar.

### Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is a single-purpose directory, containing only one TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`. This file defines a functional component named 'Navbar' that is specifically designed for the mobile application's navigation bar. The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines a functional component named 'Navbar' for the mobile application. The component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of a chat application. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation', which is an object of type 'Conversation', and 'onNewConversation', which is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button that, when clicked, triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

### Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the 'Navbar' functional component, which is a critical part of the mobile user interface. This component is responsible for displaying the currently active chat conversation and providing an interface for initiating new conversations. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The 'selectedConversation' prop is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat. The 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

### Usage & Examples

The 'Navbar' component defined in the `Navbar.tsx` file is used within the mobile version of the chatbot user interface. It is a functional component that is designed to be used in the navigation bar of a chat application. The component accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The 'selectedConversation' prop is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat. The 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated.

Here is a simplified example of how the 'Navbar' component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated. The 'Navbar' component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the 'handleNewConversation' function.
