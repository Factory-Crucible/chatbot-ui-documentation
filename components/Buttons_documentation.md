# `components/Buttons` Directory

The `components/Buttons` directory is a part of the `components` directory in the `integration-chatbot-ui` project. This directory is dedicated to housing the button components used throughout the application. These components are reusable and can be imported into other components to create a consistent user interface across the application.

## Contents

The `components/Buttons` directory contains the following subdirectory:

- `SidebarActionButton`: This subdirectory contains the `SidebarActionButton` component, which is a button component used in the application's sidebar.

The directory does not contain any standalone files.

## Folder Structure Overview

The `components/Buttons` directory follows a simple structure, with each button component housed in its own subdirectory. Each subdirectory contains an `index.ts` file for exporting the component and a `.tsx` file for defining the component.

The structure of the `components/Buttons` directory is as follows:

```
components/Buttons
└── SidebarActionButton
    ├── index.ts
    └── SidebarActionButton.tsx
```

## Key Components

The `components/Buttons` directory contains the following key component:

- `SidebarActionButton`: This is a React component that renders a button with a specific CSS class and an `onClick` event handler. The component accepts two props: `handleClick`, a mouse event handler, and `children`, a React element that is rendered inside the button. The component is defined in the `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file and exported from the `index.ts` file in the `SidebarActionButton` subdirectory.

## Usage & Examples

The button components in the `components/Buttons` directory are used throughout the `integration-chatbot-ui` application to create a consistent user interface. They are imported into other components using their respective `index.ts` files.

For example, the `SidebarActionButton` component can be imported and used in another component as follows:

```tsx
import SidebarActionButton from '../components/Buttons/SidebarActionButton';

function Sidebar() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    // Handle click event
  };

  return (
    <SidebarActionButton handleClick={handleClick}>
      <span>Button Text</span>
    </SidebarActionButton>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `SidebarActionButton` component is imported from its `index.ts` file. It is then used in the `Sidebar` component, with a `handleClick` function passed as the `handleClick` prop and a `span` element passed as the `children` prop.
