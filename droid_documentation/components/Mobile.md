# `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project, each in its own subdirectory. The `components/Mobile` directory currently contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component named 'Navbar'. This component is specifically designed for the mobile application's navigation bar and plays a crucial role in the user interface of the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application.

## Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is relatively simple in structure, containing only one file and no subdirectories. The file is:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines a functional component named 'Navbar' for the mobile application. The component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of a chat application. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation', which is an object of type 'Conversation', and 'onNewConversation', which is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button that, when clicked, triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

## Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Navbar` component defined in the `Navbar.tsx` file. This component is a critical part of the mobile user interface, providing the navigation bar for the chat application. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The 'selectedConversation' prop is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat. The 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

## Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a functional component that is designed to be used in the navigation bar of a chat application. Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated. The `Navbar` component displays the name of the `currentConversation` and an 'IconPlus' button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the `handleNewConversation` function, initiating a new conversation.
