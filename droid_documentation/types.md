## `types` Directory

The `types` directory is a crucial part of the codebase, serving as a repository for TypeScript files that define various interfaces, types, and constants used throughout the project. These definitions provide a consistent structure for data and facilitate type checking, enhancing the maintainability and reliability of the codebase. The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Contents

The `types` directory contains several TypeScript files, each defining specific interfaces, types, or constants. Here is a brief overview of each file:

- `data.ts`: Defines the `KeyValuePair` interface, representing a key-value pair structure.
- `prompt.ts`: Defines the `Prompt` interface, representing a prompt object.
- `plugin.ts`: Defines the structure and data for plugins in the application.
- `settings.ts`: Defines the `Settings` interface, specifying the theme settings for the application.
- `storage.ts`: Defines the structure of the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.
- `openai.ts`: Defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers.
- `chat.ts`: Defines various interfaces and types related to a chat system.
- `export.ts`: Defines various types and interfaces related to the export functionality of the application.
- `google.ts`: Defines several interfaces related to Google's services.
- `folder.ts`: Defines the structure of a 'Folder' object.
- `index.ts`: An empty placeholder file.
- `env.ts`: Defines an interface representing the environment variables related to the OpenAI API.
- `error.ts`: Defines an interface used to structure the error messages in the application.

### Key Components

Several files in the `types` directory are particularly noteworthy due to their extensive use throughout the codebase:

- `data.ts`: The `KeyValuePair` interface defined in this file is likely used wherever a key-value pair structure is needed, providing a consistent structure for such data.
- `prompt.ts`: The `Prompt` interface defined in this file provides a consistent structure for prompt objects throughout the codebase.
- `settings.ts`: The `Settings` interface defined in this file is likely used across the application to ensure consistent usage of the theme settings.
- `storage.ts`: The `LocalStorage` interface defined in this file outlines the structure of the local storage schema for a chatbot UI, which is crucial for managing user data and application state.
- `openai.ts`: The `OpenAIModel` interface and `OpenAIModelID` enumeration defined in this file are likely used extensively in interactions with the OpenAI API.

### Usage & Examples

The interfaces, types, and constants defined in the `types` directory are used throughout the codebase to provide structure and consistency to the data. For example, the `KeyValuePair` interface defined in `data.ts` might be used in a function that takes a key-value pair as an argument:

```typescript
function processKeyValuePair(pair: KeyValuePair) {
  // Function body
}
```

Similarly, the `Prompt` interface defined in `prompt.ts` might be used in a function that creates a new prompt:

```typescript
function createPrompt(promptData: Prompt) {
  // Function body
}
```

The `Settings` interface defined in `settings.ts` might be used in a function that updates the application's theme settings:

```typescript
function updateSettings(newSettings: Settings) {
  // Function body
}
```

The `LocalStorage` interface defined in `storage.ts` might be used in a function that interacts with the local storage:

```typescript
function updateLocalStorage(newData: LocalStorage) {
  // Function body
}
```

The `OpenAIModel` interface and `OpenAIModelID` enumeration defined in `openai.ts` might be used in a function that interacts with the OpenAI API:

```typescript
function interactWithOpenAI(model: OpenAIModel) {
  // Function body
}
```
