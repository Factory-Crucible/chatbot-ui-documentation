## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. The 'Promptbar' is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. It is a React component written in TypeScript and is composed of several files and a subdirectory, each contributing to the overall functionality of the 'Promptbar'.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains five TypeScript files and one subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the default export from the 'Promptbar.tsx' file.
- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.
- `components/Promptbar/components`: This subdirectory contains related components such as 'Prompts.tsx', 'PromptbarSettings.tsx', 'Prompt.tsx', 'PromptModal.tsx', and 'PromptFolders.tsx'.

### Key Components

The `components/Promptbar` directory houses several key files and components that contribute to the functionality of the 'Promptbar':

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, providing state and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts. This context is used throughout the 'Promptbar' component and its subcomponents to manage state and handle user interactions.

- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file for the 'Promptbar'. It uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects, and imports several other components to build the 'Promptbar' feature. It also handles user interactions such as toggling the prompt bar, creating, deleting, and updating prompts, and dropping prompts into folders.

- `components/Promptbar/components`: This subdirectory contains several related components that contribute to the functionality of the 'Promptbar'. For example, 'Prompts.tsx' renders a list of prompts, 'Prompt.tsx' manages prompts, 'PromptModal.tsx' renders a modal for editing prompts, and 'PromptFolders.tsx' manages folders within the 'Promptbar'.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to build and manage the 'Promptbar' feature of the chatbot-ui project. The 'Promptbar' is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders.

For example, the 'Promptbar.tsx' file is the main component file for the 'Promptbar'. It uses the 'PromptbarContext' defined in 'PromptBar.context.tsx' to manage state and handle user interactions. It also imports several other components from the 'components/Promptbar/components' subdirectory to build the 'Promptbar' feature.

The 'PromptBar.context.tsx' file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, providing state and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts. This context is used throughout the 'Promptbar' component and its subcomponents to manage state and handle user interactions.

The 'components/Promptbar/components' subdirectory contains several related components that contribute to the functionality of the 'Promptbar'. For example, 'Prompts.tsx' renders a list of prompts, 'Prompt.tsx' manages prompts, 'PromptModal.tsx' renders a modal for editing prompts, and 'PromptFolders.tsx' manages folders within the 'Promptbar'.
