## components/Search

The `components/Search` directory is a part of the chatbot-ui project's modular architecture, specifically within the components module. This directory is dedicated to the Search component of the chatbot user interface. The Search component is a functional React component written in TypeScript, designed to provide a search input field in the user interface. It accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' represents the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input when clicked.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two main files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that defines the structure and functionality of the Search component. It exports a functional component 'Search' that takes in three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon, providing the user with a way to input and clear search terms.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the `Search` directory, exporting the default export from the `Search.tsx` file. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Search.tsx` file. This file defines the Search component, which is a critical part of the user interface. The Search component provides the user with a way to input search terms and clear them, contributing to the overall functionality of the chatbot user interface. The `index.ts` file, while not as complex, is also important as it exports the Search component, making it accessible to other parts of the codebase.

### Usage & Examples

The Search component is used in the chatbot user interface to provide a search input field. It is a functional component that accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' prop is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' prop is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term.

Here is a simplified example of how the Search component might be used:

```typescript
import Search from './components/Search';

function App() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

  return (
    <Search
      placeholder="Search..."
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      onSearch={setSearchTerm}
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, the Search component is imported from the `Search` directory and used in the `App` component. The `App` component maintains a state variable `searchTerm` and a corresponding setter function `setSearchTerm` using the `useState` hook from React. The Search component is then rendered with the 'placeholder' prop set to "Search...", the 'searchTerm' prop set to the `searchTerm` state variable, and the 'onSearch' prop set to the `setSearchTerm` function. This allows the Search component to display the current search term and update it when the user types in the search input field or clicks the 'X' icon.
