Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It is generated and maintained by the Documentation Droid, ensuring that it remains up-to-date as the codebase evolves.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is dedicated to the development of a chatbot user interface (UI). This repository is a part of a larger system, interacting with other services to provide a comprehensive chatbot solution.

### Technologies Used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies, including:

- Docker: Used for creating a consistent environment for the application.
- Node.js: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript, enhancing code quality and understandability.
- ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
- Kubernetes: Used for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components:

- Frontend Library: Contains various React components used in the chatbot UI.
- Backend Library: Handles server-side operations, including API requests.
- CLI: Provides command-line interfaces for certain operations.

### Conventions

The codebase follows certain conventions for better understandability and consistency. These include specific file naming conventions and structured organization of code into directories based on their functionality.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into various directories, each serving a specific purpose. Some directories contain a significant amount of code, while others house static assets and are rarely utilized. The structure is outlined using the PROJECT_STRUCTURE, providing an overview of important directories.

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase are designed to handle various user stories and recurring patterns. These flows manage how data moves from one end of the system to the other. For a more in-depth understanding of these flows, refer to the respective documentation files in the directory.

### System Connections

The system connections, both internal and external, are crucial for understanding the dependencies of the codebase. The codebase interacts with various areas, including the OpenAI API and Google API, to provide comprehensive chatbot functionality. The interaction between different code areas is explained in the respective documentation files.

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows certain testing principles to ensure the quality of the code. The main types of tests include unit tests and integration tests. The '**tests**' directory is dedicated to testing within the project. For more details, refer to [`__tests__.md`](./__tests__.md).
