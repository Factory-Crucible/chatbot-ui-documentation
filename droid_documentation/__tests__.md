## __tests__ Directory

The `__tests__` directory is the central hub for all testing activities within the `chatbot-ui` project. It is designed to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase by validating the functionality of various components and modules. The directory is structured to mirror the organization of the codebase, allowing for a clear and intuitive testing environment. The primary focus within this directory is the `utils` subdirectory, which contains tests for the application's utility functions.

### Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains one subdirectory:

- `utils`: This subdirectory serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. It contains a further subdirectory named `app`, which houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.

### Key Components

The `__tests__` directory is home to the `utils` subdirectory, which is a critical component of the testing suite. The `utils` subdirectory contains a further subdirectory named `app`, which houses a test file `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named 'cleanData', which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

### Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house all the test suites for the `chatbot-ui` project. The `utils` subdirectory within it is specifically used for testing the utility functions of the application. For instance, the `importExports.test.ts` file within the `app` subdirectory of `utils` is used to test the import and export operations of the application. 

Here is a simplified example of how the `importExports.test.ts` file might be structured:

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  // Test cases for export format functions
});

describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
  // Test cases for cleanData function
});
```

In this example, the `describe` blocks are used to group related test cases. The first block groups test cases for the export format functions, while the second block groups test cases for the `cleanData` function. Each test case within these blocks would then test a specific aspect of the function it's related to.
