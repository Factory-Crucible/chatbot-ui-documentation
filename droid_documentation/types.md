## types
The `types` directory houses TypeScript files that define various interfaces, types, and constants used throughout the project. These definitions provide a consistent structure for data and ensure type safety across the codebase. The directory includes files for theme settings, key-value pair structures, prompt objects, Google's services, plugins, chat systems, environment variables for the OpenAI API, and the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.

### Contents
The `types` directory contains the following files:

- `data.ts`: Defines a 'KeyValuePair' interface, representing a key-value pair structure.
- `prompt.ts`: Defines a 'Prompt' interface, representing a prompt object.
- `plugin.ts`: Defines the structure and data for plugins in the application.
- `settings.ts`: Defines a 'Settings' interface, specifying the theme settings for the application.
- `storage.ts`: Defines the structure of the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.
- `openai.ts`: Defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers.
- `chat.ts`: Defines various interfaces and types related to a chat system.
- `export.ts`: Defines various types and interfaces related to the export functionality of the application.
- `google.ts`: Defines several interfaces related to Google's services.
- `folder.ts`: Defines the structure of a 'Folder' object.
- `index.ts`: An empty placeholder file.
- `env.ts`: Defines an interface representing the environment variables related to the OpenAI API.
- `error.ts`: Defines an interface to structure the error messages in the application.

### Key Components
- `data.ts`: Provides a consistent structure for key-value pair data across the project.
- `prompt.ts`: Ensures a consistent structure for prompt objects throughout the codebase.
- `plugin.ts`: Centralizes the structure and data for plugins, facilitating their management.
- `settings.ts`: Standardizes the usage of theme settings across the application.
- `storage.ts`: Defines the local storage schema, ensuring consistent interaction with local storage.
- `openai.ts`: Structures the data related to OpenAI models, aiding in their management.
- `chat.ts`: Provides a consistent structure for chat-related data, improving the management of chat systems.
- `export.ts`: Structures the data related to the export functionality, facilitating the import and export of data.
- `google.ts`: Structures the data related to Google's services, aiding in their management.
- `folder.ts`: Provides a consistent structure for 'Folder' objects across the project.
- `env.ts`: Structures the environment variables related to the OpenAI API, ensuring their correct usage.
- `error.ts`: Structures the error messages, improving error handling and debugging.

### Usage & Examples
The files in the `types` directory are used throughout the codebase to ensure type safety and data consistency. For example, the 'KeyValuePair' interface defined in `data.ts` is likely used wherever a key-value pair structure is needed. Similarly, the 'Prompt' interface defined in `prompt.ts` is used to provide a consistent structure for prompt objects. The 'Settings' interface in `settings.ts` is used to ensure consistent usage of the theme settings across the application. The 'LocalStorage' interface in `storage.ts` is used to interact with local storage in a consistent manner.
