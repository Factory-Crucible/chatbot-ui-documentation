## `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot user interface. It currently contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component for the navigation bar in the mobile application. This component, named 'Navbar', is a critical part of the mobile user interface, providing the user with the ability to navigate between different conversations and initiate new ones. The `Navbar` component is designed to be flexible and reusable, accepting props to customize its behavior and appearance based on the current state of the application.

### Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing only a single file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines the `Navbar` component for the mobile application's navigation bar. The component is designed to display the currently active conversation and provide a mechanism for initiating new conversations.

### Key Components

The `components/Mobile` directory houses the `Navbar` component, a critical part of the mobile user interface:

- `Navbar` Component: This functional component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of the mobile application. It accepts two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`. The `selectedConversation` prop is an object of type `Conversation` representing the currently active chat, while the `onNewConversation` prop is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button that, when clicked, triggers the `onNewConversation` function.

### Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot user interface. It is designed to be flexible and reusable, accepting props to customize its behavior and appearance based on the current state of the application.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The `Navbar` component displays the name of the `currentConversation` and an 'IconPlus' button that, when clicked, triggers the `handleNewConversation` function.
