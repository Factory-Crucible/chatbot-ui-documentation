# `pages` Directory

The `pages` directory is a pivotal part of the `chatbot-ui` project, serving as the home for key files and a subdirectory that are integral to the functioning of the application. This directory is responsible for defining the structure and behavior of the application's pages, including the main entry point for the home page (`index.tsx`), a custom Document for the Next.js application (`_document.tsx`), and a custom App component (`_app.tsx`). Additionally, it houses the `api` subdirectory, which contains files that handle API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

## Contents

The `pages` directory contains three key files and a subdirectory:

- `index.tsx`: This file serves as the main entry point for the home page of the application, exporting a React component and a server-side rendering function.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application, defining an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.

- `api`: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

## Key Components

The `pages` directory contains several critical files and subdirectories that contribute to the functionality of the `chatbot-ui` project:

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from a sibling file in the 'api' subdirectory named 'home'.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, providing a consistent structure for all pages in the application.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, making the application accessible to a global audience.

- `api`: This subdirectory is responsible for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and managing the 'home' page of the application.

## Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used to define the structure and behavior of the application's pages. For instance, the `index.tsx` file serves as the main entry point for the home page of the application, exporting a React component and a server-side rendering function. This file is typically used to render the main layout or page structure, and to fetch initial data for the page.

The `_document.tsx` file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts. This file is typically used to augment the application's `<html>` and `<body>` tags, and to set global CSS.

The `_app.tsx` file is a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization. This file is typically used to keep state when navigating between pages, for example, to keep track of a user's login state.

The `api` subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and managing the 'home' page of the application. These files are typically used to define API routes and handlers, and to manage server-side logic.
