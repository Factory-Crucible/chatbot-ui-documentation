# Directory Overview: components

The `components` directory is a central part of the `chatbot-ui` project, housing the various React components that make up the user interface of the application. Each subdirectory within `components` corresponds to a specific part of the user interface, with its own dedicated functionality and purpose. These components range from the main chat functionality to individual chat messages, system prompts, error messages, and various user interface elements such as dropdowns, sliders, and modals. The components are designed to be modular and reusable, allowing them to be used in various parts of the application.

## Contents

The `components` directory is a comprehensive collection of the various parts of the chatbot UI. It includes components for managing the chat bar, handling markdown rendering, defining various buttons, managing the search functionality, handling settings, managing the chat functionality, and more. Each subdirectory within `components` is dedicated to a specific part of the user interface, with its own dedicated functionality and purpose.

For instance, the `components/Markdown` directory is dedicated to handling markdown rendering within the chatbot UI. It contains two TypeScript component files, `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx` and `CodeBlock.tsx`, which are responsible for rendering markdown content and displaying code blocks in markdown format, respectively.

The `components/Buttons` directory contains components that define the various buttons used throughout the chatbot user interface. These buttons are integral to the user interaction with the chatbot, as they trigger various functionalities when clicked.

The `components/Search` directory houses the code that powers the search functionality in the user interface. The search component is a key interaction point for users, allowing them to quickly locate specific information or navigate through the chatbot's content.

The `components/Settings` directory is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project. The `components/Settings` directory specifically contains components that define the various settings used throughout the chatbot user interface.
