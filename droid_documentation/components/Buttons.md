# `components/Buttons` Directory

The `components/Buttons` directory is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the chatbot-ui project. This specific directory, `components/Buttons`, is dedicated to the definition and management of button components used throughout the user interface of the chatbot. The directory contains a subdirectory named `SidebarActionButton` which houses two files: `index.ts` and `SidebarActionButton.tsx`. The `index.ts` file is a module export file that simplifies import paths by re-exporting the default export from `SidebarActionButton.tsx`. The `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file defines a React component named `SidebarActionButton`, a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`.

## Contents

The `components/Buttons` directory contains one subdirectory: `SidebarActionButton`. This subdirectory includes two files: `index.ts` and `SidebarActionButton.tsx`.

- `SidebarActionButton`: This subdirectory contains the definition and export of the `SidebarActionButton` React component. The component is a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`.
- `index.ts`: This file is a module export file that simplifies import paths by re-exporting the default export from `SidebarActionButton.tsx`.
- `SidebarActionButton.tsx`: This file defines a React component named `SidebarActionButton`. The component is a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`.

## Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `SidebarActionButton` React component, defined in the `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file. This component is a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`. The `handleClick` prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the `children` prop renders any child elements within the button. The button's style includes a minimum width of 20px, padding of 1, and different text colors for normal and hover states.

## Usage & Examples

The `SidebarActionButton` component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project wherever a button with specific styling and functionality is required. The `handleClick` prop allows for custom click event handling, while the `children` prop allows for the rendering of any child elements within the button.

For example, a `SidebarActionButton` might be used in a sidebar menu to trigger a specific action when clicked. The `handleClick` prop could be passed a function that toggles the visibility of a menu, and the `children` prop could be passed a text element that labels the button.

```typescript
<SidebarActionButton handleClick={toggleMenuVisibility}>
  Toggle Menu
</SidebarActionButton>
```

In this example, clicking the `SidebarActionButton` would trigger the `toggleMenuVisibility` function, and the button would be labeled with the text "Toggle Menu".
