Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. The documentation is generated and maintained by the Documentation Droid, ensuring it stays up-to-date as the codebase evolves.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is a Docker-based Node.js project that provides a user interface for a chatbot. The chatbot UI is designed to interact with various services, including OpenAI and Google APIs, to generate prompts and send responses.

### Technologies Used

The project heavily relies on several leading technologies, including Node.js, Docker, TypeScript, and React. It also uses various tools like Makefile, Prettier, PostCSS, and Tailwind CSS for configuration and styling.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components, including a frontend library, a backend library, and a CLI. The frontend library is built with React and TypeScript, while the backend library handles API requests and responses. The CLI is used for managing the Docker application.

### Conventions

The codebase follows certain conventions, such as file naming and directory structure. Understanding these conventions is crucial for navigating the codebase.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is outlined in the SEMANTIC_STRUCTURE. It includes directories for different aspects of the project, such as components, pages, utils, hooks, services, types, and tests. The root directory contains configuration files for the project, Docker, and various tools. It also includes a Dockerfile for creating a Docker image and a 'docker-compose.yml' for defining and managing the Docker application.

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase involve data moving from one end of the system to the other. These flows are specific to certain user stories, but some patterns recur in many cases in the repo. Understanding these flows is crucial for understanding the codebase.

### System Connections

The codebase interacts with several internal and external systems. It makes API calls to OpenAI and Google APIs, and handles the responses. Understanding these system connections is crucial for understanding the dependencies of the codebase.

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows certain testing principles. It includes a '**tests**' directory for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite. The tests validate the functionality of import and export operations, and ensure that the objects being exported conform to the expected format.
