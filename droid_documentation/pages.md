## pages
The `pages` directory is a crucial part of the project, containing key files and a subdirectory. It serves as the main entry point for the application's home page, exporting a React component and a server-side rendering function. The directory also contains a custom Document for the Next.js application, defining an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts. Additionally, it houses a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization. The 'api' subdirectory within the 'pages' directory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Contents
The `pages` directory contains three files and one subdirectory. The files are `index.tsx`, `_document.tsx`, and `_app.tsx`. The subdirectory is `api`.

- `index.tsx`: This is the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function.
- `_document.tsx`: This is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.
- `_app.tsx`: This is a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api`: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components
The key components in the `pages` directory are the `index.tsx`, `_document.tsx`, and `_app.tsx` files, and the `api` subdirectory.

- `index.tsx`: This file serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are crucial for the functioning of the home page.
- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, which are essential for the proper rendering and functioning of the application.
- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component. It initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, making the application accessible to users in different languages.
- `api`: This subdirectory is responsible for handling API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, and contains files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Usage & Examples
The files and subdirectories in the `pages` directory are used to define the structure and functionality of the application's pages.

- `index.tsx`: This file is used to define the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function.

```typescript
export { default, getServerSideProps } from './api/home';
```

- `_document.tsx`: This file is used to define a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.

```typescript
type Props = DocumentProps & {};
export default function Document(props: Props) {}
```

- `_app.tsx`: This file is used to initialize pages and set up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.

```typescript
function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps<{}>) {}
```

- `api`: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, and contains files related to the 'home' page of the application.

```typescript
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};

const handler = async (req: Request): Promise<Response> => {};

export default handler;
```
