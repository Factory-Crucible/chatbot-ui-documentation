## `components/Buttons` Directory

The `components/Buttons` directory is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project encapsulated in their respective subdirectories. The `components/Buttons` directory specifically contains the definitions and implementations of different button components used across the application. These button components are reusable and can be customized via props to fit different use cases within the application. The directory currently contains a single subdirectory, `SidebarActionButton`, which defines a specific type of button used in the application's sidebar.

### Contents

The `components/Buttons` directory contains the following subdirectory:

- `SidebarActionButton`: This subdirectory houses the definition and implementation of the `SidebarActionButton` component. It contains two files: `index.ts` and `SidebarActionButton.tsx`. The `index.ts` file is a module export file that simplifies import paths by re-exporting the default export from `SidebarActionButton.tsx`. The `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file defines the `SidebarActionButton` component, a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`.

### Key Components

The `SidebarActionButton` component is a critical part of the `components/Buttons` directory. This component is a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`. The `handleClick` prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the `children` prop renders any child elements within the button. The button's style includes a minimum width of 20px, padding of 1, and different text colors for normal and hover states. This component is used in the application's sidebar, and its styling and behavior can be customized via its props to fit different use cases.

### Usage & Examples

The `SidebarActionButton` component, defined in the `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file, is used within the application's sidebar. It is a reusable component that can be customized via its props to fit different use cases. For example, it can be used to create a button that opens a modal when clicked, or a button that navigates to a different page when clicked.

Here is a simplified example of how the `SidebarActionButton` component might be used:

```jsx
import SidebarActionButton from 'components/Buttons/SidebarActionButton';

function Sidebar() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    // Handle click event
  };

  return (
    <SidebarActionButton handleClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </SidebarActionButton>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `SidebarActionButton` component is imported from its module export file (`index.ts`). A `handleClick` function is defined and passed as a prop to the `SidebarActionButton` component. The `children` prop is used to render the text "Click me" within the button.
