## `components/Folder` Directory

The `components/Folder` directory is a dedicated space for the `Folder` component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a crucial part of the user interface, representing a folder in a file system. It is a React component that is written in TypeScript and uses icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package. The `Folder` component is responsible for rendering a button and an input field, and it includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. 

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two main files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. The component accepts several props, maintains state, and renders a button and an input field. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. 
- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this folder by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file. 

There are no subdirectories in this directory.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It exports a single component, `Folder`, which represents a folder in a file system. The `Folder` component is a crucial part of the user interface, providing functionality for renaming and deleting folders, as well as handling drag and drop events. 

The `index.ts` file, while not as complex as the `Folder.tsx` file, plays a crucial role in simplifying imports from this directory. By exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file, it allows other files to import from `index.ts`, which will automatically forward the import to `Folder.tsx`.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to represent a folder in a file system. It is a versatile component that can be used in various parts of the user interface. 

Here is a simplified example of how the `Folder` component might be used:

```typescript
import Folder from '../components/Folder';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const handleDrop = (e, folder) => {
    // Handle drop event
  };

  return (
    <Folder
      currentFolder={currentFolder}
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      handleDrop={handleDrop}
      folderComponent={folderComponent}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example, the `Folder` component is imported from the `components/Folder` directory and used in a hypothetical `MyComponent`. The `Folder` component is passed several props, including a `currentFolder`, a `searchTerm`, a `handleDrop` function, and a `folderComponent`.
