# `__tests__` Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the `chatbot-ui` project. It is a crucial part of the codebase, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the code. The directory is structured to mirror the main project structure, allowing for a clear and organized approach to testing. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within `utils`, there's another subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- `utils`: This subdirectory serves as a testing suite for the utility functions within the application. It contains a subdirectory named `app`, which houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.

### Key Components

The key component in the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file. This file tests the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one. The test checks that the updated data matches the expected structure of the current format.

### Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house all the test files for the `chatbot-ui` project. The structure of the directory mirrors the main project structure, allowing for a clear and organized approach to testing. The `importExports.test.ts` file, for example, is used to test the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version and tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

Here is a simplified example of how the `importExports.test.ts` file might be structured:

```javascript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  // Test cases for export format functions
});

describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
  // Test cases for cleanData function
});
```

In this example, the `describe` blocks are used to group related test cases. The first `describe` block groups test cases for the export format functions, while the second `describe` block groups test cases for the `cleanData` function. Each `describe` block contains one or more `it` blocks, which define individual test cases.
