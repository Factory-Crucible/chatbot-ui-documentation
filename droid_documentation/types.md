## types

The `types` directory is a crucial part of the codebase, serving as the central location for TypeScript type definitions, interfaces, and constants that are used throughout the project. These definitions provide a consistent structure for data across the application, ensuring that the correct types are used and that the data adheres to the expected format. This directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Contents

The `types` directory contains several TypeScript files, each defining a specific set of types, interfaces, or constants. Here is a brief overview of each file:

- `data.ts`: Defines a key-value pair structure.
- `prompt.ts`: Outlines a prompt object.
- `plugin.ts`: Defines structures for plugins and their keys.
- `settings.ts`: Defines theme settings.
- `storage.ts`: Defines the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.
- `openai.ts`: Defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers.
- `chat.ts`: Defines various interfaces and types related to a chat system.
- `export.ts`: Defines various types and interfaces related to the export functionality of the application.
- `google.ts`: Defines several interfaces related to Google's services.
- `folder.ts`: Defines a 'Folder' object.
- `index.ts`: An empty placeholder file.
- `env.ts`: Represents environment variables for the OpenAI API.
- `error.ts`: Structures error messages.

### Key Components

Several files in the `types` directory are particularly noteworthy due to their extensive use throughout the codebase:

- `data.ts`: This file defines a 'KeyValuePair' interface, which is likely used throughout the project wherever a key-value pair structure is needed.
- `prompt.ts`: This file defines a 'Prompt' interface, which is likely used to provide a consistent structure for prompt objects throughout the codebase.
- `settings.ts`: This file defines a 'Settings' interface, which is likely used across the application to ensure consistent usage of the theme settings.
- `storage.ts`: This file defines the 'LocalStorage' interface, which is likely used to interact with the local storage of the application.
- `openai.ts`: This file defines the 'OpenAIModel' interface and the 'OpenAIModelID' enumeration, which are likely used when interacting with the OpenAI API.

### Usage & Examples

The types, interfaces, and constants defined in the `types` directory are used throughout the codebase to provide a consistent structure for data. For example, the 'KeyValuePair' interface defined in `data.ts` might be used in a function that takes a key-value pair as an argument:

```typescript
function processKeyValuePair(pair: KeyValuePair) {
  // Function body
}
```

Similarly, the 'Prompt' interface defined in `prompt.ts` might be used in a function that takes a prompt object as an argument:

```typescript
function displayPrompt(prompt: Prompt) {
  // Function body
}
```

The 'Settings' interface defined in `settings.ts` might be used in a function that updates the theme settings:

```typescript
function updateSettings(settings: Settings) {
  // Function body
}
```

The 'LocalStorage' interface defined in `storage.ts` might be used in a function that interacts with the local storage:

```typescript
function updateLocalStorage(storage: LocalStorage) {
  // Function body
}
```

The 'OpenAIModel' interface and the 'OpenAIModelID' enumeration defined in `openai.ts` might be used in a function that interacts with the OpenAI API:

```typescript
function useOpenAIModel(model: OpenAIModel) {
  // Function body
}
```
