## Styles Directory

The `styles` directory plays a crucial role in the visual presentation of the chatbot-ui project. It houses the `globals.css` file, which is responsible for defining the global styles that are applied throughout the application. This file is a key player in the project's visual consistency, as it sets the foundational styles that are used across all components and pages. It leverages the Tailwind CSS framework, a utility-first CSS framework, to provide a set of pre-defined styles that can be used throughout the project. Additionally, it includes custom styles for specific elements and scenarios, such as the webkit scrollbar and responsive design adjustments.

### Contents

The `styles` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing a single file:

- `globals.css`: This is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file that defines the global styles for the project. It imports base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework, and includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. It also sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade, and includes responsive design adjustments for screens with a maximum width of 720px.

### Key Components

The `globals.css` file is the key component in this directory. It serves as the central location for defining the global styles that are applied throughout the project. This file is critical in maintaining the visual consistency of the application, as it sets the foundational styles that are used across all components and pages.

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file is used to define the global styles for the project. These styles are applied to the entire application, ensuring a consistent look and feel across all components and pages. For example, the file sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade, providing a consistent backdrop for the application's user interface.

The file also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, enhancing the user experience for users on webkit-based browsers by providing a custom-styled scrollbar. Additionally, it includes responsive design adjustments for screens with a maximum width of 720px, ensuring that the application's layout and design remain consistent and functional across a range of device sizes.

Lastly, the file removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'. This is a specific style rule that ensures the correct display of code blocks within the application, contributing to the readability and usability of any code snippets or examples displayed in the application.
