## `components/Settings` Directory

The `components/Settings` directory is a crucial part of the `chatbot-ui` project, serving as the hub for managing the application's settings. This directory contains three TypeScript React component files, namely `SettingDialog.tsx`, `Import.tsx`, and `Key.tsx`. Each of these components plays a unique role in managing the application's settings, providing functionalities such as changing the application theme, importing data, and managing the API key settings. These components work together to provide a comprehensive settings management system for the application.

### Contents

The `components/Settings` directory contains the following files:

- `SettingDialog.tsx`: This file exports a functional component that manages a settings dialog. The dialog allows users to change the application theme and handles outside clicks to close the dialog.
- `Import.tsx`: This file provides an import functionality, rendering a file input and a button that triggers the file picker. It reads the selected file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls a function with the parsed data.
- `Key.tsx`: This file manages the API key settings, maintaining a local state for the key and a flag indicating if the key is being changed. It handles key press events, updates the key when 'Enter' is pressed, and focuses on the input field when the key is being changed. It renders either an input field for changing the key or a button to initiate the change, depending on the state.

### Key Components

The `components/Settings` directory houses three key components that are integral to the settings management of the `chatbot-ui` project:

- `SettingDialog`: This component manages the settings dialog, providing an interface for users to change the application theme. It also handles outside clicks to close the dialog, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- `Import`: This component provides an import functionality, allowing users to import data into the application. It reads the selected file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls a function with the parsed data, facilitating data import.
- `Key`: This component manages the API key settings, maintaining a local state for the key and a flag indicating if the key is being changed. It handles key press events, updates the key when 'Enter' is pressed, and focuses on the input field when the key is being changed, ensuring efficient management of the API key settings.

### Usage & Examples

The components in the `components/Settings` directory are used within the `chatbot-ui` project to manage the application's settings. Here are some examples of how these components are used:

- `SettingDialog`: This component is used whenever the settings dialog needs to be displayed. It is rendered with the 'open' prop set to 'true' to make the dialog visible. The 'onClose' prop is set to a function that sets the 'open' state to 'false', closing the dialog.
- `Import`: This component is used to provide an import functionality for the application. It is rendered with the 'onImport' prop set to a function that handles the imported data.
- `Key`: This component is used to manage the API key settings. It is rendered with the 'apiKey' prop set to the current API key and the 'onApiKeyChange' prop set to a function that updates the API key.
