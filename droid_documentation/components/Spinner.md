## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a visual element that indicates a loading state in the user interface. It is a reusable component that can be utilized in various parts of the application where a loading state needs to be communicated to the user. The Spinner component is designed to be flexible, accepting optional props for size and additional CSS classes, allowing it to be customized to fit different contexts within the application.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the entry point for the Spinner component. It exports the default export from the `Spinner.tsx` file, simplifying the import process in other parts of the codebase.

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. It is a React component that renders an SVG-based spinner animation. The component accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className', which control the dimensions of the spinner and allow for additional CSS classes, respectively.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Spinner.tsx` file. This file defines the Spinner component, which is a critical part of the user interface. The Spinner component is used throughout the application to indicate loading states, providing a visual cue to the user that a process is underway. This component is designed with flexibility in mind, accepting optional props that allow it to be customized to fit different contexts and visual styles within the application.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate loading states. It can be imported directly from the `components/Spinner` directory, thanks to the `index.ts` file, which exports the default export from `Spinner.tsx`.

The Spinner component can be used in a variety of contexts. For example, it could be used when fetching data from an API, where the Spinner is displayed while the data is being retrieved and then replaced with the data once it has been fetched.

Here is a simplified example of how the Spinner component might be used in a React component:

```typescript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

const DataFetchingComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  const fetchData = async () => {
    // Fetch data from an API
    // ...

    // Once data is fetched, set loading to false
    setLoading(false);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {loading ? <Spinner /> : <div>{data}</div>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default DataFetchingComponent;
```

In this example, the Spinner component is displayed while the data is being fetched from an API. Once the data has been fetched, the Spinner is replaced with the fetched data.
