## Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a pivotal part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the home for key files and subdirectories that are integral to the functioning of the application. This directory is responsible for defining the main entry point for the home page, setting up the custom Document and App components for the Next.js application, and handling API requests and responses. The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory work in unison to provide a seamless user experience, manage state, handle API calls, and support internationalization.

### Contents

The `pages` directory is composed of three TypeScript files and an `api` subdirectory. Each of these files and the subdirectory play a unique role in the functioning of the application.

- `index.tsx`: Serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function.
- `_document.tsx`: Defines a custom Document for the Next.js application, providing an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.
- `_app.tsx`: Initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api`: A subdirectory that contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

The `pages` directory houses several key components that are critical to the functioning of the chatbot-ui project.

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from a sibling file in the `api` subdirectory named `home`.
- `_document.tsx`: This file defines a custom Document for the Next.js application. It sets up an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.
- `_app.tsx`: This file initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, making the application accessible to a global audience.
- `api`: This subdirectory is responsible for handling API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, and contains files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used to define the main entry point for the home page, set up the custom Document and App components for the Next.js application, and handle API requests and responses.

For instance, the `index.tsx` file serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from a sibling file in the `api` subdirectory named `home`.

```typescript
export { default, getServerSideProps } from './api/home';
```

The `_document.tsx` file defines a custom Document for the Next.js application. It sets up an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

```typescript
type Props = DocumentProps & {};
export default function Document(props: Props) {}
```

The `_app.tsx` file initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, making the application accessible to a global audience.

The `api` subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, and contains files related to the 'home' page of the application. For example, the `chat.ts` file serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality, processing requests, encoding messages, and interacting with an OpenAI service.

```typescript
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};

const handler = async (req: Request): Promise<Response> => {
};

export default handler;
```
