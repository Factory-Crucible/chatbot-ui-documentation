# `k8s` Directory Documentation

The `k8s` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. It is responsible for the Kubernetes configurations that are essential for the deployment and operation of the chatbot UI application. The directory contains a single file, `chatbot-ui.yaml`, which outlines the Kubernetes resources necessary for the application. These resources include a Namespace, a Secret, a Deployment, and a Service. 

## Contents

The `k8s` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing only a single file, `chatbot-ui.yaml`. This file holds the Kubernetes configurations for the chatbot UI application. There are no subdirectories within the `k8s` directory.

- `k8s/chatbot-ui.yaml`: This is a Kubernetes configuration file that defines the necessary resources for the chatbot UI application. It outlines a Namespace, a Secret, a Deployment, and a Service.

## Key Components

The `k8s` directory's key component is the `chatbot-ui.yaml` file. This file is critical as it outlines the Kubernetes resources necessary for the chatbot UI application. 

- **Namespace 'chatbot-ui'**: This isolates the chatbot UI resources, providing a scope for names and ensuring that the resources are unique and organized.

- **Secret**: This securely stores the OpenAI API key in a base64 encoded format, ensuring that sensitive data is kept secure.

- **Deployment**: This details the Docker image to be used, the number of replicas, and the container port. It also retrieves the OpenAI API key from the Secret, ensuring that the application has the necessary credentials to function.

- **Service**: This exposes the Deployment on port 80 and routes traffic to the container port 3000. This allows the application to be accessible and handle incoming traffic.

## Usage & Examples

The `k8s` directory is used to manage the Kubernetes configurations for the chatbot UI application. The `chatbot-ui.yaml` file within this directory is used to define the necessary Kubernetes resources for the application. 

For instance, the Namespace 'chatbot-ui' is created to isolate the resources of the chatbot UI. This ensures that the resources are unique and organized, preventing conflicts with other resources in the Kubernetes cluster.

The Secret is used to store the OpenAI API key in a secure, base64 encoded format. This ensures that the sensitive API key is kept secure and is only accessible to the necessary parts of the application.

The Deployment specifies the Docker image to be used, the number of replicas, and the container port. It also retrieves the OpenAI API key from the Secret. This ensures that the application is deployed correctly and has the necessary credentials to function.

The Service exposes the Deployment on port 80 and routes traffic to the container port 3000. This allows the application to be accessible and handle incoming traffic.

While the `k8s` directory does not contain any code snippets, its usage is critical for the deployment and operation of the chatbot UI application.
