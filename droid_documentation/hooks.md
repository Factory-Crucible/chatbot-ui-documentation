# `hooks` Directory

The `hooks` directory is a specialized section of the codebase that houses custom React hooks. These hooks, defined within TypeScript files, are designed to provide reusable logic for state management and HTTP requests. The directory contains two files: `useCreateReducer.ts` and `useFetch.ts`. Each file exports a custom hook that encapsulates specific functionality, allowing for code reuse and separation of concerns.

## Contents

The `hooks` directory contains the following files:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This TypeScript file defines a custom React hook named `useCreateReducer`. The hook is designed to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. It also defines two TypeScript types: `FieldNames` and `ActionType`.
- `useFetch.ts`: This TypeScript file exports a custom React hook named `useFetch`. The hook provides methods for making HTTP requests. It also defines two types, `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel`, to structure the request parameters.

## Key Components

The `hooks` directory contains two key components:

- `useCreateReducer`: This custom hook is designed to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. It takes an object with an `initialState` property as an argument. The hook uses `useReducer` and `useMemo` from React to manage state and optimize performance.
- `useFetch`: This custom hook provides methods for making HTTP requests. Each method uses a helper function `handleFetch` to perform the actual fetch operation. The `handleFetch` function takes care of constructing the request URL, body, and headers, and handles the response based on its content type. It also handles errors and throws them for further handling.

## Usage & Examples

The hooks defined in the `hooks` directory are used throughout the codebase to manage state and make HTTP requests.

For instance, the `useCreateReducer` hook can be used to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. Here's a simplified example:

```typescript
import { useCreateReducer } from './hooks/useCreateReducer';

const { state, dispatch } = useCreateReducer({ initialState: { count: 0 } });

dispatch({ type: 'increment' });
```

Similarly, the `useFetch` hook can be used to make HTTP requests. Here's a simplified example:

```typescript
import { useFetch } from './hooks/useFetch';

const { get } = useFetch();

const fetchData = async () => {
  const data = await get('/api/data');
  console.log(data);
};

fetchData();
```

Please note that these examples are simplified and may not represent the actual usage within the codebase. Always refer to the actual code for accurate usage patterns.
