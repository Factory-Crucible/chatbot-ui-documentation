## components/Folder Directory

The `components/Folder` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the implementation of a React component that represents a folder in a file system. This directory is composed of two TypeScript files, `index.ts` and `Folder.tsx`, which work in tandem to provide a robust and interactive folder component. The `Folder.tsx` file is the heart of this directory, encapsulating the logic, state management, and rendering of the folder component. The `index.ts` file, on the other hand, serves as a conduit for streamlined imports from this directory. The absence of subdirectories in this directory underscores its focused purpose.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory houses two TypeScript files:

1. `index.ts`: This file simplifies the import process from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects to streamline imports.

2. `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`, which represents a folder in a file system. The component accepts several props, maintains state, and renders a button and an input field. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is the cornerstone of this directory. It exports a `Folder` component that encapsulates the functionality of a folder in a file system. The component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component renders a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The component uses several icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used throughout the codebase to represent a folder in a file system. It is a versatile component that can be customized through its props. For instance, the `currentFolder` prop can be used to set the folder that the component represents, the `searchTerm` prop can be used to filter the contents of the folder, and the `handleDrop` prop can be used to handle drag and drop events.

Here is an example of how the `Folder` component might be used:

```typescript
import Folder from './components/Folder';

const App = () => {
  const handleDrop = (e, folder) => {
    // Handle drop event
  };

  return (
    <Folder
      currentFolder={myFolder}
      searchTerm={mySearchTerm}
      handleDrop={handleDrop}
      folderComponent={myFolderComponents}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example, the `Folder` component is imported from the `components/Folder` directory and used in the `App` component. The `currentFolder`, `searchTerm`, `handleDrop`, and `folderComponent` props are passed to the `Folder` component.
