## `components/Search` Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project. This specific directory is dedicated to the `Search` component of the chatbot user interface. The `Search` component is a functional component that provides an input field for users to search within the chatbot UI. It accepts three props: `placeholder`, `searchTerm`, and `onSearch`. The `placeholder` is a string displayed when the search input is empty. The `searchTerm` represents the current search term, and `onSearch` is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the `searchTerm` and calls `onSearch` when its value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input when clicked.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two main files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that exports a functional component named `Search`. The component accepts three props and renders an input field and an 'X' icon for search functionality.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the `Search` directory, exporting the default from `Search.tsx`.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Search` component, defined in the `Search.tsx` file. This component is crucial as it provides the search functionality within the chatbot UI. It accepts three props that control its behavior and appearance, and it renders an input field and an 'X' icon that allow users to input and clear their search terms.

### Usage & Examples

The `Search` component is used within the chatbot UI to provide search functionality. It is a functional component that accepts three props:

- `placeholder`: A string that is displayed when the search input is empty.
- `searchTerm`: The current search term.
- `onSearch`: A function that updates the search term.

The component renders an input field that displays the `searchTerm` and calls `onSearch` when its value changes. It also renders an 'X' icon that, when clicked, clears the search input by calling `onSearch` with an empty string.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Search` component might be used:

```typescript
<Search
  placeholder="Search..."
  searchTerm={currentSearchTerm}
  onSearch={updateSearchTerm}
/>
```

In this example, `currentSearchTerm` is a state variable that holds the current search term, and `updateSearchTerm` is a function that updates this state variable. The `placeholder` prop is set to the string "Search...", which is displayed when the search input is empty.
