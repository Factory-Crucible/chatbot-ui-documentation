## Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a pivotal part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the home for key files and a subdirectory that are integral to the functioning of the application. This directory is where the main entry point for the home page resides, along with custom Document and App components for the Next.js application. The `api` subdirectory within this directory is responsible for handling API requests and responses, interacting with external APIs such as OpenAI and Google APIs, and managing files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Contents

The `pages` directory contains three TypeScript files and one subdirectory:

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function.
- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application, defining an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.
- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api`: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

- `index.tsx`: This file is crucial as it serves as the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports two items: 'default' and 'getServerSideProps', both of which are imported from a sibling file in the 'api' subdirectory named 'home'. The 'default' export is likely the main React component for the home page, while 'getServerSideProps' is a function used in Next.js for server-side rendering on the home page.
- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for a Next.js application. It defines a 'Document' function that takes 'props' as a parameter, which is a combination of 'DocumentProps' and custom document properties. The function returns an HTML document structure with a 'lang' attribute set to the current locale. The 'Head' section contains metadata for Apple mobile web app compatibility and title. The 'body' section contains the main content and Next.js scripts.
- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api`: This subdirectory is a key component of the `pages` directory. It contains three files and a subdirectory. 'models.ts' handles requests related to OpenAI models, constructing URLs and fetching data from the OpenAI API. 'chat.ts' serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality, processing requests, encoding messages, and interacting with an OpenAI service. 'google.ts' handles API requests and responses, interacting with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API to generate prompts and send responses. The 'home' subdirectory contains files related to the 'home' page of the application, including an entry point file, a main page React component, a state definition file, and a context definition file.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used to manage the main entry point of the application, handle API requests and responses, and manage the 'home' page of the application.

For instance, the `index.tsx` file is used as the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, which are imported from the 'home' file in the 'api' subdirectory.

```typescript
export { default, getServerSideProps } from './api/home';
```

The `_document.tsx` file is used to define a custom Document for the Next.js application, defining an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.

```typescript
type Props = DocumentProps & {};
export default function Document(props: Props) {}
```

The `api` subdirectory is used to handle API requests and responses, interact with OpenAI and Google APIs, and manage files related to the 'home' page of the application. For example, the 'chat.ts' file serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality, processing requests, encoding messages, and interacting with an OpenAI service.

```typescript
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};

const handler = async (req: Request): Promise<Response> => {
};

export default handler;
```
