## Hooks Directory

The `hooks` directory is a specialized section of the codebase that houses custom React hooks. These hooks, defined in TypeScript, are designed to provide reusable logic for state management and HTTP requests. The directory contains two files: `useCreateReducer.ts` and `useFetch.ts`. Each of these files exports a custom hook that encapsulates a specific functionality, allowing for code reuse and separation of concerns.

### Contents

The `hooks` directory is composed of two TypeScript files:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file defines a custom hook named `useCreateReducer` that creates a typed reducer with dispatch and state. It also defines two types, `FieldNames` and `ActionType`, that are used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.
- `useFetch.ts`: This file exports a custom hook named `useFetch` that is used for making HTTP requests. It defines two types, `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel`, that structure the request parameters. The hook provides methods for each HTTP verb and uses a helper function, `handleFetch`, to perform the actual fetch operation.

### Key Components

The `hooks` directory contains two key components:

- `useCreateReducer`: This custom hook is a critical part of state management in the application. It provides a typed reducer with dispatch and state, allowing for type-safe state updates. The `FieldNames` and `ActionType` types defined in this file are used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action, ensuring that the reducer's state and actions are correctly typed.
- `useFetch`: This custom hook is essential for making HTTP requests within the application. It provides a structured and reusable way to make requests and handle responses. The `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel` types structure the request parameters, ensuring that requests are correctly formed. The `handleFetch` helper function performs the actual fetch operation, handling the construction of the request and the processing of the response.

### Usage & Examples

The hooks defined in the `hooks` directory are used throughout the codebase to manage state and make HTTP requests.

The `useCreateReducer` hook is used to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. It takes an object with an `initialState` property as an argument. Here's an example of how it might be used:

```typescript
const { state, dispatch } = useCreateReducer({ initialState: { count: 0 } });
```

The `useFetch` hook is used to make HTTP requests. It provides methods for each HTTP verb (get, post, put, patch, delete). Each method uses the `handleFetch` helper function to perform the actual fetch operation. Here's an example of how it might be used:

```typescript
const { get, post } = useFetch();
const data = await get('/api/data');
const response = await post('/api/data', { body: { key: 'value' } });
```

Please note that these examples are illustrative and may not represent actual usage in the codebase.
