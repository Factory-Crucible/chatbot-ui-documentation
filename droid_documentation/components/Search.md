## `components/Search` Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a part of the chatbot-ui project's component architecture, specifically designed to handle the search functionality within the user interface. This directory contains two main files: `Search.tsx` and `index.ts`. The `Search.tsx` file is a TypeScript React component that exports a functional component named 'Search'. This component is responsible for rendering the search input field and managing the search functionality. The `index.ts` file serves as the public interface for the directory, exporting the default from `Search.tsx`.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains the following files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that exports a functional component named 'Search'. The component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the directory, exporting the default export from the sibling file 'Search.tsx'. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Search.tsx` file. This file exports a functional component named 'Search', which is responsible for rendering the search input field and managing the search functionality. The component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' prop is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' prop is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.

### Usage & Examples

The `Search` component is used within the chatbot-ui project to provide a search functionality in the user interface. It is typically used in conjunction with other components to form a complete user interface. The 'placeholder' prop can be used to provide a hint to the user about what they can search for. The 'searchTerm' prop is used to display the current search term in the input field, and the 'onSearch' prop is used to update this term when the user types in the input field or clicks the 'X' icon to clear the search input.

For example, the `Search` component could be used in a parent component like this:

```typescript
import Search from './components/Search';

function ParentComponent() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

  return (
    <Search
      placeholder="Search for a chat"
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      onSearch={setSearchTerm}
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, the `Search` component is imported from the 'Search' directory and used in the `ParentComponent`. The 'placeholder' prop is set to "Search for a chat", the 'searchTerm' prop is bound to the 'searchTerm' state variable, and the 'onSearch' prop is bound to the 'setSearchTerm' function. This allows the `Search` component to display the current search term and update it when the user types in the input field or clicks the 'X' icon to clear the search input.
