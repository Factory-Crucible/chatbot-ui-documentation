Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the codebase and the documentation. These docs are generated and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes by the Documentation Droid.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to provide a user interface for a chatbot application. It is a Docker-based Node.js project that uses TypeScript and React. The repository is part of a larger system, interacting with other services to provide a complete chatbot solution.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies. It uses Docker for containerization, Node.js for the runtime environment, and TypeScript for static typing. The frontend is built with React, and the styling is managed with Tailwind CSS. The project also uses Kubernetes for orchestration.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, while the 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The '**tests**' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

### Conventions

The codebase follows several conventions. File naming follows the pattern of using lowercase letters and separating words with periods. The project uses a directory structure that separates different aspects of the project into their respective directories, such as 'components', 'pages', 'utils', 'hooks', 'services', 'types', and 'k8s'.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. Some directories contain a significant amount of code, while others contain static assets and are rarely utilized. The root directory of the project contains configuration files for the project, Docker, and various tools like Makefile, Prettier, PostCSS, and Tailwind CSS. It also includes a Dockerfile for creating a Docker image and a 'docker-compose.yml' for defining and managing the Docker application. The 'package.json' file lists the project's dependencies and scripts. The project uses TypeScript, with the 'tsconfig.json' file configuring the TypeScript compiler.

The 'public' directory contains branding files and a 'screenshots' subdirectory. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, while the 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The '**tests**' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

The structure of the codebase can be visualized as follows:

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the chatbot UI. The 'components' directory houses the various parts of the UI, such as the chat bar, settings, sidebar, and prompts. The 'pages' directory contains the main entry points for the application, with the 'api' subdirectory handling API requests. The 'utils' directory provides utility functions for various aspects of the project, such as managing chat conversations, handling import and export of chatbot data, and making POST requests to the OpenAI API. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks, and the 'services' directory provides services for error handling and API calls.

Data flows from the user's interactions with the UI, through the components, and into the backend via API calls. The responses from these API calls are then processed and displayed back to the user through the UI. For a more in-depth understanding of these flows, refer to the individual documentation files in the 'droid_documentation' directory, such as ['components.md'](components/README.md), ['pages.md'](pages.md), and ['utils.md'](utils.md).

### System Connections

The system interacts with external services, such as the OpenAI API and the Google Custom Search API. The 'api' subdirectory in the 'pages' directory contains files for handling these interactions. The 'models.ts' file constructs URLs and fetches data from the OpenAI API, while the 'google.ts' file interacts with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API to generate prompts and send responses.

The codebase also includes a 'k8s' directory, which contains Kubernetes configurations for deploying the application. The 'chatbot-ui.yaml' file defines four Kubernetes resources: a Namespace, a Secret, a Deployment, and a Service. The Secret stores the OpenAI API key in a secure, base64 encoded format, and the Deployment retrieves this key from the Secret.

## Testing Principles

The '**tests**' directory is dedicated to testing in the project. It contains a 'utils' subdirectory, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. The 'importExports.test.ts' file validates the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. It also tests a function named 'cleanData', which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format. For more details, refer to the ['**tests**.md'](__tests__.md) file.
