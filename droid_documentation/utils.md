## Utils Directory

The `utils` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as a hub for utility files and subdirectories that handle various aspects of the project. This directory is divided into three subdirectories: `app`, `server`, and `data`, each with a specific focus. The `app` subdirectory contains utility files that manage application-level operations such as saving folders to local storage, mapping programming languages to file extensions, managing chat conversations, and handling the import and export of chatbot data. The `server` subdirectory provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and a function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API. It also contains a function that standardizes text data. The `data` subdirectory contains a 'throttle' function that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed. 

### Contents

The `utils` directory is organized into three subdirectories and a file:

- `app`: This subdirectory contains utility files for a chatbot UI project. It includes files for managing folders, mapping programming languages to file extensions, managing chat conversations, and handling the import and export of chatbot data.
- `server`: This subdirectory provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and a function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API. It also contains a function that standardizes text data.
- `data`: This subdirectory contains a 'throttle' function that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed.
- `.DS_Store`: This file has no available description.

### Key Components

The `utils` directory contains several key components that are critical to the functioning of the chatbot-ui project:

- `app/const.ts`: This file defines several constants used throughout the application, primarily related to the configuration of the OpenAI API and some default settings for the chatbot.
- `app/settings.ts`: This file manages application settings, interacting with local storage to retrieve and store settings.
- `app/api.ts`: This file determines the appropriate API endpoint based on the provided plugin.
- `server/index.ts`: This file provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and an 'OpenAIStream' function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API.
- `data/throttle.ts`: This file defines a 'throttle' function that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `utils` directory are used throughout the codebase to perform various utility functions:

- The `app/const.ts` file is used to provide constants for the OpenAI API configuration and default chatbot settings. These constants are used in various parts of the application where interaction with the OpenAI API or chatbot settings is required.
- The `app/settings.ts` file is used to manage application settings. The `getSettings` function is used to retrieve settings from local storage, while the `saveSettings` function is used to store settings in local storage.
- The `app/api.ts` file is used to determine the appropriate API endpoint based on the provided plugin. This is used in parts of the application where API requests are made.
- The `server/index.ts` file is used to handle server-side operations. The 'OpenAIError' class is used to handle errors from the OpenAI API, while the 'OpenAIStream' function is used to make POST requests to the OpenAI API.
- The `data/throttle.ts` file is used to control the rate at which a given function can be executed. This is used in parts of the application where rate limiting is required.
