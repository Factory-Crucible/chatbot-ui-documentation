## utils

The `utils` directory is a collection of utility files and subdirectories that provide various functionalities for the project. These utilities range from managing chat conversations, saving folders to local storage, mapping programming languages to file extensions, to handling the import and export of chatbot data. The directory is divided into three subdirectories: `app`, `server`, and `data`, each serving a specific purpose.

### Contents

The `utils` directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- `app`: This subdirectory houses various utility files for a chatbot UI project. It manages everything from saving folders to local storage, mapping programming languages to file extensions, managing chat conversations, and handling the import and export of chatbot data.
- `server`: This subdirectory provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and a function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API. It also contains a function that standardizes text data.
- `data`: This subdirectory contains a 'throttle' function that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed.
- `.DS_Store`: This file has no available description.

### Key Components

- `app/const.ts`: This file defines several constants used throughout the application, primarily related to the configuration of the OpenAI API and some default settings for the chatbot.
- `app/folders.ts`: This file manages saving folders to local storage.
- `app/codeblock.ts`: This file contains a map of programming languages to their respective file extensions and a function to generate a random string.
- `app/settings.ts`: This file manages application settings and interacts with local storage.
- `app/api.ts`: This file determines the appropriate API endpoint based on the provided plugin.
- `app/prompts.ts`: This file provides functions for managing 'Prompt' objects.
- `app/importExport.ts`: This file handles the import and export of chatbot data.
- `app/conversation.ts`: This file provides functions for managing chat conversations.
- `app/clean.ts`: This file ensures the presence of certain properties in conversation objects and cleans conversation history.
- `server/index.ts`: This file provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and an 'OpenAIStream' function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API.
- `server/google.ts`: This file contains a 'cleanSourceText' function that standardizes text data by performing various transformations.
- `data/throttle.ts`: This file defines a generic function 'throttle' that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed.

### Usage & Examples

The utility files in the `utils` directory are used throughout the codebase to provide various functionalities. For instance, the `app/const.ts` file defines constants that are used in various parts of the application, such as the OpenAI API configuration and default chatbot settings. The `app/folders.ts` file provides a function to save folders to local storage, which is used when the user creates or modifies folders in the application. The `app/codeblock.ts` file provides a map of programming languages to file extensions, which is used when handling code blocks in various programming languages in the application.

The `server/index.ts` file provides an 'OpenAIError' class and an 'OpenAIStream' function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API. These are used when the application needs to communicate with the OpenAI API, for instance, when the chatbot needs to generate a response to a user's message.

The `data/throttle.ts` file provides a 'throttle' function that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed. This can be used in various parts of the application where it is necessary to limit the rate of function execution, for instance, to prevent excessive API calls or to control the rate of user interactions.
