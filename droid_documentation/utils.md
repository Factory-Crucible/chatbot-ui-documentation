# `utils` Directory

The `utils` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. It houses a collection of utility files and subdirectories that provide a variety of functions and operations to support the chatbot UI project. These utilities range from managing chat conversations, saving folders to local storage, mapping programming languages to file extensions, to handling the import and export of chatbot data. The directory is divided into three subdirectories: `app`, `server`, and `data`, each serving a specific purpose and containing related utility files.

## Contents

The `utils` directory contains three subdirectories and a `.DS_Store` file. The subdirectories are `app`, `server`, and `data`. Each subdirectory contains utility files related to a specific aspect of the project.

- `app`: This subdirectory contains utility files for the chatbot UI project. It includes files for managing folders, mapping programming languages to file extensions, managing chat conversations, and handling the import and export of chatbot data.
- `server`: This subdirectory provides utility functions for server-side operations. It includes an `OpenAIError` class and a function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API. It also contains a function that standardizes text data.
- `data`: This subdirectory contains a `throttle` function that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed.
- `.DS_Store`: This file has no available description.

## Key Components

The `utils` directory contains several key components that are critical to the functioning of the chatbot UI project.

- `app/const.ts`: This file defines several constants used throughout the application, primarily related to the configuration of the OpenAI API and some default settings for the chatbot.
- `app/settings.ts`: This file manages application settings, interacting with local storage to retrieve and store settings.
- `app/api.ts`: This file determines the appropriate API endpoint based on the provided plugin.
- `server/index.ts`: This file provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an `OpenAIError` class and an `OpenAIStream` function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API.
- `data/throttle.ts`: This file defines a generic function `throttle` that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed.

## Usage & Examples

The utility files and subdirectories in the `utils` directory are used throughout the codebase to perform a variety of functions.

- The `app` subdirectory contains utility files that are used in the chatbot UI project. For example, the `folders.ts` file contains a function `saveFolders` that is used to save an array of folders to local storage. The `settings.ts` file contains functions `getSettings` and `saveSettings` that are used to retrieve and store application settings in local storage.
- The `server` subdirectory provides utility functions for server-side operations. For instance, the `index.ts` file contains an `OpenAIStream` function that is used to make POST requests to the OpenAI API.
- The `data` subdirectory contains a `throttle` function that is used to control the rate at which a given function can be executed. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a function needs to be called repeatedly, but not more than a certain number of times per second.
- The `.DS_Store` file is a system file created by the macOS operating system. It is not directly used in the codebase.
