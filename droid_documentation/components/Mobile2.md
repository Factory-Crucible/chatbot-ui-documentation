## components/Mobile2

The `components/Mobile2` directory is dedicated to the `Mobile2` module of the chatbot UI application. It contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional React component named `Navbar`. This component is a key part of the user interface, rendering a navigation bar that displays the name of a selected conversation and an `IconPlus` icon. The `Navbar` component is designed to be interactive, triggering a function when the `IconPlus` icon is clicked.

### Contents

The `components/Mobile2` directory contains one file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines the `Navbar` functional component. It is the only file in the `components/Mobile2` directory.

### Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the `Navbar` functional component, which is a critical part of the user interface in the `Mobile2` module. The `Navbar` component is designed to display the name of a selected conversation and an `IconPlus` icon, and to trigger a function when the `IconPlus` icon is clicked.

### Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the `Mobile2` module of the chatbot UI application. It accepts two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`. The `selectedConversation` prop is of type `Conversation` and represents the currently selected conversation. The `onNewConversation` prop is a function that is triggered when the `IconPlus` icon is clicked.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
import { Navbar } from './components/Mobile2/Navbar';

const App = () => {
  const [selectedConversation, setSelectedConversation] = useState<Conversation>(null);

  const handleNewConversation = () => {
    // Logic to handle new conversation creation
  };

  return (
    <Navbar
      selectedConversation={selectedConversation}
      onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example, the `Navbar` component is imported from the `components/Mobile2/Navbar` file. It is then used in the `App` component, with the `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation` props being passed in. The `selectedConversation` prop is set to the current state of `selectedConversation`, and the `onNewConversation` prop is set to the `handleNewConversation` function, which would contain the logic to handle the creation of a new conversation.
