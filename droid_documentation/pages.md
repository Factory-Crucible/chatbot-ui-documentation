# `pages` Directory

The `pages` directory is a pivotal part of the project, serving as the container for key files and a subdirectory. It is responsible for defining the main entry point for the home page, custom Document and App components for the Next.js application, and handling API requests and responses. The directory also interacts with external APIs such as OpenAI and Google APIs, and manages the 'home' page of the application.

## Contents

The `pages` directory contains three TypeScript files and an `api` subdirectory.

- `index.tsx`: Serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function.
- `_document.tsx`: Defines a custom Document for the Next.js application, outlining an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.
- `_app.tsx`: Initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api`: Contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

## Key Components

- `index.tsx`: This file is crucial as it serves as the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports two items: 'default' and 'getServerSideProps', both of which are imported from a sibling file in the 'api' subdirectory named 'home'.
- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for a Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, which is essential for the proper rendering and functionality of the application.
- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, making the application accessible to a wider audience.
- `api`: This subdirectory is responsible for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and managing the 'home' page of the application.

## Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `pages` directory are used to define the main entry point for the home page, custom Document and App components for the Next.js application, and handle API requests and responses. They also interact with external APIs such as OpenAI and Google APIs, and manage the 'home' page of the application.

For instance, the `index.tsx` file exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, which are used to render the home page of the application. The `_document.tsx` file defines a custom Document for the Next.js application, outlining an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts. The `_app.tsx` file initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries, and also supports internationalization. The `api` subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and managing the 'home' page of the application.
