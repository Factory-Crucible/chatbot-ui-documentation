## Hooks Directory

The `hooks` directory is a specialized section of the codebase that houses custom React hooks. These hooks are designed to encapsulate specific functionalities that are reused across the codebase. The hooks in this directory are `useCreateReducer` and `useFetch`, each defined in their respective TypeScript files. These hooks are integral to the state management and HTTP request handling within the chatbot-ui project.

### Contents

The `hooks` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useCreateReducer` that is designed to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. It also defines two TypeScript types: `FieldNames` and `ActionType`.

- `useFetch.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named `useFetch` for making HTTP requests. It defines two types, `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel`, to structure the request parameters.

### Key Components

The `hooks` directory contains two key components:

- `useCreateReducer`: This hook is a crucial part of the state management in the chatbot-ui project. It creates a reducer with typed dispatch and state, ensuring type safety and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors. The `FieldNames` and `ActionType` types defined in this file are used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action, providing a structured and predictable state management system.

- `useFetch`: This hook is responsible for making HTTP requests within the chatbot-ui project. It provides methods for each HTTP verb (get, post, put, patch, delete), encapsulating the logic for making requests and handling responses. The `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel` types defined in this file structure the request parameters, ensuring that requests are made correctly and consistently.

### Usage & Examples

The hooks in this directory are used throughout the chatbot-ui project to manage state and make HTTP requests.

- `useCreateReducer` is used to create reducers with typed dispatch and state. It takes an object with an `initialState` property as an argument. For example, it might be used to create a reducer for managing the state of a chat conversation.

- `useFetch` is used to make HTTP requests. It returns an object with methods for each HTTP verb. These methods use a helper function `handleFetch` to perform the actual fetch operation. For example, the `get` method might be used to fetch chatbot data from an API.

Please note that the above examples are illustrative and may not represent actual usage patterns in the chatbot-ui project.
