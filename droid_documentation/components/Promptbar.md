## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. This feature is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. The directory contains TypeScript files that define the structure, state, and context of the 'Promptbar' component. It also includes a subdirectory named 'components' that houses related components such as 'Prompts', 'PromptbarSettings', 'Prompt', 'PromptModal', and 'PromptFolders'.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory is structured with several TypeScript files and a subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: Serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the default export from the 'Promptbar.tsx' file.
- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: Defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: The main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: Defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.
- `components`: A subdirectory that contains related components such as 'Prompts', 'PromptbarSettings', 'Prompt', 'PromptModal', and 'PromptFolders'.

### Key Components

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several key files and components that contribute to the functionality of the 'Promptbar' feature:

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This file is crucial as it defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component. It outlines the shape of the context, including the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file for the 'Promptbar'. It represents a sidebar in the UI and includes functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file is important as it defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.
- `components/Prompt.tsx`: This component handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and manages local state for various functionalities.
- `components/PromptModal.tsx`: This component renders a modal for editing a prompt, with internationalization support.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to manage the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. For instance, the 'Promptbar.tsx' file is the main component file for the 'Promptbar', representing a sidebar in the UI and including functions for managing prompts and folders. The 'PromptBar.context.tsx' file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts.

The 'components' subdirectory contains related components such as 'Prompts', 'PromptbarSettings', 'Prompt', 'PromptModal', and 'PromptFolders'. For example, the 'Prompt.tsx' component handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and manages local state for various functionalities. The 'PromptModal.tsx' component renders a modal for editing a prompt, with internationalization support.

While the skeleton code provided in the DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE is not representative of typical usage, it does provide an overview of the structure and functionality of these components. For instance, the 'Prompt.tsx' component takes a 'prompt' prop of type 'Prompt', uses the 'PromptbarContext' to dispatch actions and handle updates and deletions of prompts, and manages local state for showing a modal, deleting, renaming, and the rename value.
