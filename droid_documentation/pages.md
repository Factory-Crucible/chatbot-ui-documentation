## Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a vital part of the `chatbot-ui` project, serving as the container for key files and subdirectories that define the structure and behavior of the application's pages. This directory is a fundamental aspect of the Next.js framework, where each file corresponds to a route in the application. The files in this directory are responsible for rendering the user interface, handling server-side rendering, and managing API requests and responses. The `pages` directory also includes an `api` subdirectory, which contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Contents

The `pages` directory contains three key files and one subdirectory:

- `index.tsx`: This is the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the 'home' file in the 'api' subdirectory.
- `_document.tsx`: This is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.
- `_app.tsx`: This is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries.
- `api`: This is a subdirectory that contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

The `pages` directory contains several key components that play a crucial role in the functioning of the `chatbot-ui` project:

- `index.tsx`: This file serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from a sibling file in the 'api' subdirectory named 'home'.
- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.
- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries.
- `api`: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used to define the structure and behavior of the application's pages. For instance, the `index.tsx` file serves as the main entry point for the application's home page, exporting a React component and a server-side rendering function. The `_document.tsx` file is a custom Document for the Next.js application, defining an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supporting internationalization. The `_app.tsx` file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries.

The `api` subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application. For example, the `models.ts` file handles requests related to OpenAI models, constructing URLs and fetching data from the OpenAI API. The `chat.ts` file serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality, processing requests, encoding messages, and interacting with an OpenAI service. The `google.ts` file handles API requests and responses, interacting with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API to generate prompts and send responses.
