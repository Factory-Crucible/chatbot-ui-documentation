## `components/Buttons` Directory

The `components/Buttons` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to defining and managing the various button components used throughout the chatbot user interface. These button components are integral to the user interaction with the chatbot, providing the means for users to trigger various functionalities. The directory is structured to contain subdirectories for each specific button component, with each subdirectory housing the TypeScript files that define the respective button component.

### Contents

The `components/Buttons` directory contains a single subdirectory named `SidebarActionButton`. This subdirectory is dedicated to the `SidebarActionButton` component, a specific type of button used in the sidebar of the chatbot user interface.

- `SidebarActionButton`: This subdirectory contains two TypeScript files, `index.ts` and `SidebarActionButton.tsx`. The `index.ts` file is a module export file that simplifies the import paths by re-exporting the default export from `SidebarActionButton.tsx`. The `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file defines the `SidebarActionButton` component, a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`.

### Key Components

The key component within the `components/Buttons` directory is the `SidebarActionButton` component, defined within the `SidebarActionButton` subdirectory. This component is a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`.

- `SidebarActionButton`: This React component is a button designed for use in the sidebar of the chatbot user interface. It has a minimum width of 20px, padding of 1, and different text colors for normal and hover states. The `handleClick` prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the `children` prop renders any child elements within the button.

### Usage & Examples

The `SidebarActionButton` component is used within the sidebar of the chatbot user interface. It is a button that triggers specific functionalities when clicked, with the exact functionality determined by the `handleClick` prop. The `children` prop allows for the rendering of any child elements within the button, providing flexibility in the button's content.

For example, a `SidebarActionButton` might be used to trigger the opening of a settings modal. The `handleClick` prop would be a function that sets the state of the settings modal to open, and the `children` prop might render an icon indicating the settings functionality.
