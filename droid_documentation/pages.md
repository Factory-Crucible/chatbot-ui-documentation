# `pages` Directory

The `pages` directory is a fundamental part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the home for key files and subdirectories that define the structure and functionality of the application's pages. This directory is a crucial component of the Next.js framework, which the project is built upon. In Next.js, the `pages` directory is special because every file inside this directory becomes a route automatically. The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory work together to define the application's routing, server-side rendering, and API endpoints.

## Contents

The `pages` directory contains three TypeScript files (`index.tsx`, `_document.tsx`, `_app.tsx`) and a subdirectory (`api`). Each file and subdirectory plays a unique role in the application:

- `index.tsx`: Serves as the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function.

- `_document.tsx`: Defines a custom Document for the Next.js application, providing an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.

- `_app.tsx`: Initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.

- `api`: Contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

## Key Components

The `pages` directory contains several key components that are critical to the functioning of the chatbot-ui application:

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from a sibling file in the 'api' subdirectory named 'home'.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts. This is crucial for the overall structure and layout of the application.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, making the application accessible to users in different languages.

- `api`: This subdirectory is responsible for handling API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, and contains files related to the 'home' page of the application.

## Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used to define the structure and functionality of the application's pages. For instance, the `index.tsx` file serves as the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from a sibling file in the 'api' subdirectory named 'home'.

The `_document.tsx` file defines a custom Document for the Next.js application. It provides an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts. This is crucial for the overall structure and layout of the application.

The `_app.tsx` file initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, making the application accessible to users in different languages.

The `api` subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, and contains files related to the 'home' page of the application. For example, the `models.ts` file handles requests related to OpenAI models, constructing URLs and fetching data from the OpenAI API. The `chat.ts` file serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality, processing requests, encoding messages, and interacting with an OpenAI service. The `google.ts` file handles API requests and responses, interacting with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API to generate prompts and send responses.
