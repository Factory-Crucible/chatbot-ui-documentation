## Hooks Directory

The Hooks directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses two TypeScript files that define custom React hooks, `useCreateReducer.ts` and `useFetch.ts`. These hooks play a significant role in the application's state management and HTTP request handling, respectively. The hooks are designed to be reusable across the application, promoting code modularity and maintainability.

### Contents

The Hooks directory is straightforward, containing only two TypeScript files and no subdirectories. The files are:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook for creating a typed reducer with dispatch and state. It also defines two types, `FieldNames` and `ActionType`, for managing the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.

- `useFetch.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook for making HTTP requests. It defines two types, `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel`, to structure the request parameters. The hook provides methods for each HTTP verb and uses a helper function, `handleFetch`, to perform the actual fetch operation.

### Key Components

The Hooks directory contains two key components:

- `useCreateReducer` Hook: This hook is a critical part of the application's state management. It allows for the creation of a reducer with typed dispatch and state, enhancing type safety and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors. The `FieldNames` and `ActionType` types defined in this file are integral to managing the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.

- `useFetch` Hook: This hook is central to the application's HTTP request handling. It provides a structured and reusable way to make HTTP requests, with methods for each HTTP verb. The `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel` types defined in this file structure the request parameters, ensuring consistency across all HTTP requests made in the application. The `handleFetch` helper function within `useFetch` is responsible for constructing the request and handling the response, including error handling.

### Usage & Examples

The hooks defined in this directory are used throughout the application to manage state and handle HTTP requests.

The `useCreateReducer` hook is used to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. For example, it might be used in a component that needs to manage a complex state with multiple fields. The `FieldNames` and `ActionType` types ensure that the reducer's initial state and dispatch action are correctly typed.

The `useFetch` hook is used to make HTTP requests. For example, it might be used in a service that needs to fetch data from an API. The `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel` types structure the request parameters, while the `handleFetch` helper function performs the actual fetch operation and handles the response. This hook provides a consistent and reusable way to make HTTP requests across the application.
