## components/Settings

The `components/Settings` directory houses three TypeScript React components that manage various settings of the chatbot UI. These components handle the settings dialog, import functionality, and API key settings. They work together to provide a user-friendly interface for managing the application's settings.

### Contents

The `components/Settings` directory contains the following files:

- `SettingDialog.tsx`: Manages a settings dialog, allowing users to change the application theme and handling outside clicks to close the dialog.
- `Import.tsx`: Provides an import functionality, rendering a file input and a button that triggers the file picker. It reads the selected file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls a function with the parsed data.
- `Key.tsx`: Manages the API key settings, maintaining a local state for the key and a flag indicating if the key is being changed. It handles key press events, updates the key when 'Enter' is pressed, and focuses on the input field when the key is being changed.

### Key Components

- `SettingDialog.tsx`: This component fetches the current settings using the `getSettings` utility function and allows the user to change the theme of the application. The new settings are saved using the `saveSettings` utility function. The component also handles outside clicks to close the dialog.
- `Import.tsx`: This component renders an input of type 'file' and a 'SidebarButton'. When the button is clicked, it triggers the file input click event to open the file picker. When a file is selected, it reads the file as text and parses it as JSON, then calls the 'onImport' function with the parsed data.
- `Key.tsx`: This component handles key press events and updates the API key when the 'Enter' key is pressed. It also uses an effect to focus on the input field when the key is being changed. The component renders either an input field for changing the key or a button to initiate the change, depending on the state.

### Usage & Examples

The components in this directory are used to manage the settings of the chatbot UI. They are typically used in the settings section of the application. For example, the `SettingDialog.tsx` component is used to display a dialog where users can change the application theme. The `Import.tsx` component is used to import data into the application, and the `Key.tsx` component is used to manage the API key settings.
