## `components/Search` Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the home for the Search component. This component is responsible for providing a search functionality within the user interface of the chatbot. It is a TypeScript React component that accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' represents the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input when clicked. 

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two main files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that exports a functional component named 'Search'. It is responsible for rendering the search input field and the 'X' icon, and handling their interactions.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the directory, exporting the default from 'Search.tsx'. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory.

### Key Components

The key components in the `components/Search` directory are the `Search.tsx` and `index.ts` files.

- `Search.tsx`: This file is the heart of the Search component. It defines the functional component 'Search' that takes in three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.
- `index.ts`: This file is crucial for the organization and structure of the codebase. It exports the default export from the sibling file 'Search.tsx', serving as the public interface for the 'Search' directory. This means that any other parts of the code that import from the 'Search' directory will automatically receive the default export from 'Search.tsx'.

### Usage & Examples

The Search component is used within the chatbot user interface to provide a search functionality. It is a functional component that accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term.

Here is a simplified example of how the Search component might be used:

```typescript
import Search from './components/Search';

function App() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

  return (
    <Search
      placeholder="Search..."
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      onSearch={setSearchTerm}
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, the Search component is imported from the 'Search' directory and used in the 'App' component. The 'App' component maintains a state variable 'searchTerm' and a corresponding setter function 'setSearchTerm'. The Search component is rendered with the 'placeholder' prop set to "Search...", the 'searchTerm' prop set to the state variable 'searchTerm', and the 'onSearch' prop set to the setter function 'setSearchTerm'. This means that when the user types into the search input, the 'searchTerm' state in the 'App' component will be updated, and when the 'X' icon is clicked, the 'searchTerm' state will be cleared.
