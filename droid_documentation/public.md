# Public Directory

The `public` directory serves as a repository for static files that are directly accessible by the web server. This directory is a standard feature in many web development frameworks, including Next.js, which is used in this project. The files in this directory are served at the root (`/`) URL path. This means that a file named `screenshot.png` in the `public` directory would be accessible at the URL path `/screenshot.png`.

## Contents

The `public` directory contains a mix of files and a subdirectory. The files include `screenshot.png`, `favicon.ico`, and `.DS_Store`. The `screenshot.png` and `favicon.ico` files are typically used for website branding. The `.DS_Store` file is a system file created by macOS and is not relevant to the project's functionality. 

The directory also contains a subdirectory named `screenshots`. This subdirectory is dedicated to storing screenshot files. Currently, it contains a single file named `screenshot-0402023.jpg`.

### Files

- `favicon.ico`: This is a standard icon file that is displayed in the browser tab next to the page title. It is a part of the website's branding.
- `screenshot.png`: This file is typically used for website branding or for providing a preview of the website's appearance.
- `.DS_Store`: This is a system file created by macOS. It is not relevant to the project's functionality.

### Subdirectories

- `screenshots`: This subdirectory is dedicated to storing screenshot files. It currently contains a single file named `screenshot-0402023.jpg`.

## Key Components

The key components of the `public` directory are the `favicon.ico` and `screenshot.png` files. These files are typically used for website branding. The `favicon.ico` file is displayed in the browser tab next to the page title, while the `screenshot.png` file can be used for providing a preview of the website's appearance.

The `screenshots` subdirectory is also a key component of the `public` directory. It is dedicated to storing screenshot files, which can be used for various purposes, such as documentation, marketing, or user support.

## Usage & Examples

The files in the `public` directory are directly accessible by the web server. This means that they can be accessed via the URL path `/`. For example, the `favicon.ico` file can be accessed at the URL path `/favicon.ico`, and the `screenshot.png` file can be accessed at the URL path `/screenshot.png`.

The files in the `screenshots` subdirectory can be accessed via the URL path `/screenshots`. For example, the `screenshot-0402023.jpg` file can be accessed at the URL path `/screenshots/screenshot-0402023.jpg`.
