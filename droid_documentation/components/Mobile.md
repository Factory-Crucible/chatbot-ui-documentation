## `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a dedicated space for the mobile-specific components of the chatbot-ui project. It is a crucial part of the project's responsive design strategy, ensuring that the chatbot interface remains user-friendly and functional across different device types. The directory currently contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component for the mobile application's navigation bar. This component is a critical part of the mobile user interface, providing users with the ability to navigate between different conversations and initiate new ones.

### Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is a simple, single-layered directory with no subdirectories. It contains one TypeScript file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This file defines the `Navbar` functional component, which is used in the mobile version of the chatbot application. The component accepts two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`. The `selectedConversation` prop represents the currently active chat, while the `onNewConversation` prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated.

### Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the `Navbar` functional component, which is a critical part of the mobile user interface. The `Navbar` component displays the name of the currently selected conversation and includes an 'IconPlus' button that users can click to start a new conversation. This component plays a crucial role in the user's navigation experience on mobile devices, allowing them to easily switch between different conversations and start new ones.

### Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot application. It is typically rendered at the top of the screen, providing a consistent navigation interface for users. The component is designed to accept two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`.

The `selectedConversation` prop is an object of type `Conversation`, representing the currently active chat. This prop is used to display the name of the selected conversation in the navigation bar.

The `onNewConversation` prop is a function that is triggered when the user clicks the 'IconPlus' button. This function typically initiates a new conversation in the chatbot application.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that initiates a new conversation when the 'IconPlus' button is clicked.
