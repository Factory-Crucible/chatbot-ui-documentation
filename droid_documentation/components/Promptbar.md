## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. The 'Promptbar' is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. The directory contains TypeScript files and a subdirectory, each contributing to the overall functionality of the 'Promptbar' component.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory named `components`. The TypeScript files include `index.ts`, `PromptBar.context.tsx`, `Promptbar.tsx`, and `Promptbar.state.tsx`. The `index.ts` file serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the default export from the `Promptbar.tsx` file. The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. The `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file, representing the sidebar in the user interface. The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory contains related components, including `Prompts.tsx`, `PromptbarSettings.tsx`, `Prompt.tsx`, `PromptModal.tsx`, and `PromptFolders.tsx`. Each of these components contributes to the functionality of the 'Promptbar' component, managing prompts, folders, and settings.

### Key Components

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is a key component in the `components/Promptbar` directory. It defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. This context is used throughout the 'Promptbar' component and its subcomponents to manage state and handle actions.

The `Promptbar.tsx` file is another critical component. It represents the 'Promptbar' sidebar in the user interface and includes functions for managing prompts and folders. It uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects, and it imports several other components and contexts.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory contains several important components. The `Prompt.tsx` file exports a 'PromptComponent' that handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts. The `PromptModal.tsx` file exports a component that renders a modal for editing a prompt. The `PromptFolders.tsx` file exports a component that handles the display and functionality of folders within the 'Promptbar'.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders in the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to build and manage the 'Promptbar' feature of the chatbot-ui application. The 'Promptbar' is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders.

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is used to define the context for the 'Promptbar' component. This context is then used in the `Promptbar.tsx` file and the components in the `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory to manage state and handle actions.

For example, the `Prompt.tsx` file in the `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory uses the 'PromptbarContext' to dispatch actions and handle updates and deletions of prompts. It also manages local state for showing a modal, deleting, renaming, and the rename value.

The `PromptModal.tsx` file in the same subdirectory uses the 'PromptbarContext' to handle the editing of a prompt. It renders a modal with input fields for the name, description, and content of the prompt, and it listens for 'Enter' key press to update the prompt and close the modal.

The `PromptFolders.tsx` file also in the `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory uses the 'PromptbarContext' to handle the display and functionality of folders within the 'Promptbar'. It handles the dropping of prompts into folders, updating the prompt's folderId when dropped.
