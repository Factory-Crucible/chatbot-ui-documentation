Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the repository, including its purpose, technologies used, major components, conventions, structure, main flows, and testing principles. These docs are generated and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes by the Documentation Droid.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to provide a user interface for a chatbot application. It is a part of a larger system where it interacts with other services to provide a comprehensive chatbot solution. The repository is responsible for handling user interactions, managing chat conversations, and providing a seamless user experience.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies. It is a Docker-based Node.js project that uses TypeScript for static typing. The frontend is built using ReactJS, and the styling is managed by Tailwind CSS. The project also uses Kubernetes for container orchestration.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different aspect of the user interface. The 'pages' directory contains key files that serve as the entry points to the codebase. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants.

### Conventions

The codebase follows certain conventions for better understanding and maintainability. File naming follows a consistent pattern where the name indicates the purpose of the file. For instance, 'Chatbar.tsx' is a React component representing the chat bar, and 'chat.ts' serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality. The directory structure is organized based on the functionality of the files contained within.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into directories based on their functionality. Here is a high-level overview of the directory structure:

```
.
├── __tests__
├── components
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
├── public
├── services
├── styles
├── types
└── utils
```

The '**tests**' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'public' directory contains branding files and a 'screenshots' subdirectory. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'styles' directory contains a single file, 'globals.css', that holds the global styles for the project. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project.

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around managing chat conversations, handling user interactions, and making API calls. The 'Chat' component in the 'components' directory is responsible for handling the chat functionality. It interacts with the 'Chatbar' component for user inputs and displays the chat messages. The 'Chatbar' component also interacts with the 'Promptbar' component for managing prompts and folders. The 'api' directory in 'pages' handles API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs.

For a more in-depth understanding of the flow, refer to the following documentation files:

- [Chat Component](components/Chat.md)
- [Chatbar Component](components/Chatbar.md)
- [Promptbar Component](components/Promptbar.md)
- [API Handlers](pages.md)

### System Connections

The system interacts with external services like OpenAI and Google APIs. The 'api' directory in 'pages' contains files for handling these API requests and responses. The 'models.ts' file in 'api' handles requests related to OpenAI models, and 'google.ts' interacts with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API to generate prompts and send responses.

## Testing Principles

The testing principles in the codebase are defined in the '**tests**' directory. It contains a 'utils' subdirectory that serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. The 'importExports.test.ts' file in the 'app' subdirectory validates the functionality of import and export operations. It ensures that exported objects align with the expected format for each version and tests the 'cleanData' function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

For more details on testing, refer to the [Testing Documentation](__tests__.md).
