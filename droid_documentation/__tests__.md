## **tests** Directory

The `__tests__` directory is the central hub for all testing activities within the project. It is structured to mirror the main codebase, allowing for a clear and organized approach to testing. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which is dedicated to testing the utility functions of the application. Within this, there is a further subdirectory named `app`, which contains a test file for the import and export operations of the application.

### Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- `utils`: This subdirectory serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. It contains a further subdirectory named `app`.
  
  - `app`: This subdirectory houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.

### Key Components

The key component within the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named 'cleanData', which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

### Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house all test files and suites for the application. The structure of the directory mirrors the main codebase, allowing for a clear and organized approach to testing. For example, the `utils` subdirectory contains tests for utility functions, while the `app` subdirectory within `utils` contains tests for the import and export operations.

The `importExports.test.ts` file within the `app` subdirectory is a key example of how testing is conducted within the project. This file contains tests for different versions of the export format, checking whether a given object matches the expected format for each version. It also tests the 'cleanData' function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest format. The tests ensure that the cleaned data matches the expected structure of the latest format.
