## Hooks Directory

The Hooks directory is a critical part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses two TypeScript files that define custom React hooks, `useCreateReducer.ts` and `useFetch.ts`. These hooks are instrumental in managing state and making HTTP requests respectively, thereby playing a pivotal role in the application's data flow and interactions.

### Contents

The Hooks directory is straightforward in its structure, containing only two TypeScript files and no subdirectories. The two files, `useCreateReducer.ts` and `useFetch.ts`, each define a custom React hook that serves a specific purpose within the codebase.

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useCreateReducer` that creates a typed reducer with dispatch and state. It also defines two TypeScript types, `FieldNames` and `ActionType`, which are used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.

- `useFetch.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named `useFetch` that is used for making HTTP requests. It defines two types, `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel`, to structure the request parameters. The hook provides methods for each HTTP verb and uses a helper function, `handleFetch`, to perform the actual fetch operation.

### Key Components

The Hooks directory contains two key components, `useCreateReducer.ts` and `useFetch.ts`, which are integral to the application's functionality.

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: The `useCreateReducer` hook is a critical part of the application's state management. By creating a typed reducer with dispatch and state, it ensures type safety and predictability in the application's state changes. The `FieldNames` and `ActionType` types further enhance the reducer's robustness by providing a structured way to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.

- `useFetch.ts`: The `useFetch` hook is essential for the application's data fetching needs. It provides a structured and reusable way to make HTTP requests, with methods for each HTTP verb. The `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel` types ensure a consistent structure for request parameters, while the `handleFetch` helper function takes care of constructing the request and handling the response, including error handling.

### Usage & Examples

The hooks defined in the Hooks directory are used throughout the codebase to manage state and make HTTP requests.

- `useCreateReducer`: This hook is used whenever there is a need to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. For example, it could be used in a component that needs to manage a complex state with multiple fields and actions.

- `useFetch`: This hook is used for all HTTP requests within the application. For example, it could be used in a service that needs to fetch data from an API. The service would call the appropriate method on the `useFetch` hook, passing in the necessary parameters, and the hook would take care of making the request and returning the response.

Please note that the provided code snippets are not actual code from the codebase, but rather illustrative examples of how these hooks might be used.
