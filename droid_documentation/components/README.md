# Directory Overview: components

The `components` directory is a key part of the `chatbot-ui` project, housing various subdirectories each dedicated to a specific part of the user interface. Each subdirectory contains TypeScript files defining React components that collectively form the chatbot UI. These components handle various aspects of the chatbot functionality, including message input, message display, error handling, model selection, temperature adjustment, system prompts, and more.

## Contents

The `components` directory is organized into several subdirectories, each serving a specific purpose in the chatbot UI. For instance, the `Markdown` subdirectory houses components responsible for rendering markdown content and displaying code blocks. The `Buttons` subdirectory defines and manages the button components used throughout the user interface. The `Search` subdirectory is dedicated to the Search component, providing a search functionality within the chatbot. The `Settings` subdirectory manages the settings of the application, handling the settings dialog, import functionality, and API key settings. The `Chat` subdirectory houses components that form the chat interface of the application. The `Chatbar` subdirectory manages the chat bar of the chatbot application. The `Spinner` subdirectory is dedicated to the Spinner component, which displays a spinning animation to indicate a loading state. The `Sidebar` subdirectory houses the Sidebar component, which handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. The `Promptbar` subdirectory houses the `Promptbar` component, which represents a sidebar in the user interface, with functions for managing prompts and folders. The `Folder` subdirectory is dedicated to the `Folder` React component, which represents a folder in a file system. The `Mobile` subdirectory is dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot UI application.
