## Styles Directory

The `styles` directory is a dedicated space for managing the global styles of the chatbot-ui project. It plays a crucial role in defining the visual aesthetics of the application, ensuring a consistent look and feel across all components. The directory contains a single file, `globals.css`, which serves as the central hub for the project's global styles. This file leverages the utility-first CSS framework, Tailwind CSS, and includes custom styles for specific elements and conditions.

### Contents

The `styles` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing only one file:

- `globals.css`: This is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file that holds the global styles for the project. It is responsible for importing base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework and defining custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. The file also sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade and includes a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Additionally, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Key Components

The `globals.css` file is the key component in this directory. It serves as the central location for defining the global styles of the chatbot-ui project. The file's importance lies in its role in maintaining the visual consistency of the application, as it sets the global styles that are applied across all components. It also includes custom styles for specific elements and conditions, ensuring the application's responsiveness and usability on different screen sizes.
