# Directory Overview: components

The `components` directory is a central part of the `chatbot-ui` project, housing the various React components that collectively form the user interface of the application. Each subdirectory within `components` corresponds to a specific part of the user interface, such as the Sidebar, Settings, Buttons, Chatbar, Chat, Markdown, Folder, Spinner, Promptbar, Search, and Mobile components. These components are responsible for rendering the user interface, managing state, handling user interactions, and providing various functionalities.

## Contents

The `components` directory is a collection of subdirectories, each dedicated to a specific part of the user interface. For instance, the `components/Sidebar` directory houses the logic and structure for the sidebar, a key component of the user interface. Similarly, the `components/Settings` directory is dedicated to defining and managing the various settings used throughout the user interface of the chatbot. The `components/Chat` directory, on the other hand, houses the React components that collectively form the chat interface of the application.

Each subdirectory within `components` is structured into several TypeScript files, each serving a specific purpose. These files define the various React components, manage state, handle user interactions, and provide various functionalities. Some directories also contain subdirectories that house related components.

## Structure

The `components` directory is structured into several subdirectories, each corresponding to a specific part of the user interface. Here is a high-level overview of these subdirectories:

- [`components/Sidebar`](./components/Sidebar.md): Houses the logic and structure for the sidebar, a key component of the user interface.
- [`components/Settings`](./components/Settings.md): Dedicated to defining and managing the various settings used throughout the user interface of the chatbot.
- [`components/Buttons`](./components/Buttons.md): Defines and manages the various buttons used throughout the user interface of the chatbot.
- [`components/Chatbar`](./components/Chatbar.md): Houses the logic and structure for the chat bar, a key component of the user interface.
- [`components/Chat`](./components/Chat.md): Houses the React components that collectively form the chat interface of the application.
- [`components/Markdown`](./components/Markdown.md): Dedicated to handling markdown rendering within the chatbot UI.
- [`components/Folder`](./components/Folder.md): Handles the representation and interaction of a folder in a file system within the user interface.
- [`components/Spinner`](./components/Spinner.md): Displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface.
- [`components/Promptbar`](./components/Promptbar.md): Houses the logic and structure for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application.
- [`components/Search`](./components/Search.md): Contains the code for the 'Search' component of the chatbot user interface.
- [`components/Mobile`](./components/Mobile.md): Houses the logic and structure for the mobile version of the chatbot user interface.

Each subdirectory name is a clickable link that points to its corresponding detailed documentation.
