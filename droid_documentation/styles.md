## Styles Directory

The Styles directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses the 'globals.css' file, which is responsible for defining the global styles that are applied throughout the project. This directory plays a significant role in shaping the visual aesthetics and user experience of the chatbot UI. The styles defined in this directory are used across various components and modules, ensuring a consistent look and feel throughout the application.

### Contents

The Styles directory is straightforward in its structure, containing only a single file:

- `globals.css`: This is a CSS file that holds the global styles for the project. It is responsible for importing base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework, and includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. The file also sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade. It contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Additionally, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `globals.css` file. This file is critical as it defines the global styles that are applied throughout the project. It ensures a consistent visual experience across the application by setting the HTML document's background color, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under certain conditions, and removing padding from specific 'pre' elements. It also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, enhancing the user experience on webkit-based browsers.

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file in the Styles directory is used to apply global styles across the entire chatbot UI. It is loaded by the Next.js application and the styles defined in it are applied to all the components and pages of the application.

For instance, the file sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade. This means that all pages of the application will have a dark background color, providing a consistent visual experience for the users.

The file also includes a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px. This media query adjusts the width of 'pre' elements under this condition, ensuring that the application's layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

Additionally, the file removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'. This is an example of how the global styles can target specific elements in the application, providing fine-grained control over the application's appearance.
