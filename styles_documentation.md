## Styles Directory

The `styles` directory is a crucial part of the `integration-chatbot-ui` project. It houses the CSS files that define the visual aesthetics of the application. The directory is responsible for maintaining the global styles that are applied throughout the project, ensuring a consistent look and feel across all components and pages. The directory primarily uses Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, for styling. It also includes custom styles for specific elements like the webkit scrollbar and media query styles for responsive design.

### Contents

The `styles` directory contains the following file:

- `globals.css`: This is a CSS file that contains global styles for the project. It includes Tailwind CSS directives for base, components, and utilities. It also contains custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, including its track, thumb, and corner, with different styles for hover states. The scrollbar's width and height are defined as well. The HTML background color is set to a dark shade. There are also media query styles for elements with a maximum width of 720px, specifically for the 'pre' tag and its width calculation. Additionally, there is a style rule for 'pre' tags that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock', setting their padding to zero.

### Folder Structure Overview

The `styles` directory is straightforward and does not contain any subdirectories. It directly houses the `globals.css` file, which is responsible for defining the global styles used throughout the project.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `globals.css` file. This file is critical as it defines the global styles that are applied across the entire application. It uses Tailwind CSS directives for base, components, and utilities, and also includes custom styles for specific elements and responsive design. You can find more detailed information about this file in the [globals.css documentation](./globals.css.md).

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file in the `styles` directory is used to apply global styles across the entire application. It is imported in the main application file, ensuring that the defined styles are applied throughout the project. The file uses Tailwind CSS directives for base, components, and utilities, providing a wide range of styles that can be used in the application.

For example, the file defines custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, including its track, thumb, and corner, with different styles for hover states. This ensures a consistent and visually appealing scrollbar across the application. The file also includes media query styles for responsive design, ensuring that the application looks good on devices of all sizes.
