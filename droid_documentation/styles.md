# `styles` Directory

The `styles` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It is responsible for defining the global styles that are applied across the entire application. The directory contains a single file, `globals.css`, which holds the CSS rules that are universally applied to the project. This file is instrumental in maintaining the visual consistency of the application, as it sets the foundational styles that are inherited by all other components. It also includes custom styles for specific elements and scenarios, such as the webkit scrollbar and media queries for responsive design.

## Contents

The `styles` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing a single file:

- `globals.css`: This is a CSS file that contains the global styles for the project. It is responsible for setting the foundational styles that are inherited by all other components in the application. It also includes custom styles for specific elements and scenarios.

## Key Components

The `styles` directory revolves around one key file:

- `globals.css`: This file is the heart of the `styles` directory. It imports base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework, a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs. The file also contains custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, including its track, thumb, and corner, with different styles for hover states. It sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade. Additionally, it contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Lastly, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

## Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file in the `styles` directory is used to define the global styles that are applied across the entire application. It is loaded at the highest level of the application, ensuring that its styles are available to all components. 

For example, the file sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade. This means that unless a component specifies a different background color, it will inherit this dark shade by default. 

The file also contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px. This media query adjusts the width of 'pre' elements under this condition, ensuring that the application's layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. 

Lastly, the file removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'. This is an example of a specific style rule that targets a particular scenario in the application. 

In all these ways, the `globals.css` file plays a crucial role in shaping the look and feel of the chatbot-ui application.
