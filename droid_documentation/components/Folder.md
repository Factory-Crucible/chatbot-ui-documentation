## components/Folder

The `components/Folder` directory is dedicated to the implementation of the `Folder` component, a crucial part of the user interface of the chatbot application. This component is a visual representation of a folder in a file system, providing an intuitive way for users to navigate through different sections of the chatbot application. The `Folder` component is a React component written in TypeScript, and it encapsulates the functionality for renaming, deleting, and handling drag and drop events for the folder it represents. It also maintains its state, such as whether it is being renamed or deleted, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component uses icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package to enhance the user experience.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two main files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is the main file of the directory. It exports a single component, `Folder`, which represents a folder in a file system. The component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. The component maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component renders a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The component uses several icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package.

- `index.ts`: This file is a simple TypeScript file that exports the default export from the sibling file `Folder.tsx`. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects to simplify imports from this folder. Instead of importing directly from `Folder.tsx`, other files can import from `index.ts`, which will automatically forward the import to `Folder.tsx`.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Folder` component, which is defined in the `Folder.tsx` file. This component is crucial because it provides a visual representation of a folder in a file system, allowing users to navigate through different sections of the chatbot application. The `Folder` component encapsulates the functionality for renaming, deleting, and handling drag and drop events for the folder it represents. It also maintains its state, such as whether it is being renamed or deleted, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component uses icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package to enhance the user experience.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used throughout the chatbot application to represent folders in the file system. It is a versatile component that can be used in various parts of the application where folder navigation is required. The component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. These props allow the component to be customized to fit the specific needs of the part of the application where it is used.

For example, the `Folder` component could be used in a file explorer feature of the application. The `currentFolder` prop could be set to the current folder in the file explorer, the `searchTerm` prop could be set to the current search term in the file explorer, the `handleDrop` prop could be set to a function that handles dropping files into the folder, and the `folderComponent` prop could be set to a list of `Folder` components that represent the subfolders of the current folder.
