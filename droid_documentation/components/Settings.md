## components/Settings Directory

The `components/Settings` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the hub for managing the application's settings. This directory contains three TypeScript React component files: `SettingDialog.tsx`, `Import.tsx`, and `Key.tsx`. Each of these files exports a functional component that contributes to the settings management of the application. The components handle tasks such as managing a settings dialog, providing import functionality, and managing API key settings. These components are integral to the application's functionality, allowing users to customize their experience and interact with the chatbot in a seamless and efficient manner.

### Contents

The `components/Settings` directory contains three TypeScript files:

- `SettingDialog.tsx`: This file exports a functional component that manages a settings dialog. The dialog allows users to change the application theme and handles outside clicks to close the dialog.
- `Import.tsx`: This file provides an import functionality, rendering a file input and a button that triggers the file picker. It reads the selected file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls a function with the parsed data.
- `Key.tsx`: This file manages the API key settings, maintaining a local state for the key and a flag indicating if the key is being changed. It handles key press events, updates the key when 'Enter' is pressed, and focuses on the input field when the key is being changed. It renders either an input field for changing the key or a button to initiate the change, depending on the state.

### Key Components

The `components/Settings` directory contains three key components:

- `SettingDialog`: This component manages a settings dialog, allowing users to change the application theme. It uses several hooks, including `useContext`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`, and `useRef`. It also uses the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next` for internationalization. The component fetches the current settings using the `getSettings` utility function and allows the user to change the theme of the application. The new settings are saved using the `saveSettings` utility function. The component also handles outside clicks to close the dialog.
- `Import`: This component provides an import functionality for the application. It uses the `next-i18next` library for internationalization and the `@tabler/icons-react` library for icons. The component accepts a prop `onImport` which is a function that takes a parameter of type `SupportedExportFormats`. The component renders an input of type 'file' and a `SidebarButton`. When the button is clicked, it triggers the file input click event to open the file picker. When a file is selected, it reads the file as text and parses it as JSON, then calls the `onImport` function with the parsed data.
- `Key`: This component manages the API key settings for the application. It takes in two props: `apiKey` and `onApiKeyChange`. It maintains a local state for the API key and a boolean flag to indicate whether the key is being changed. The component handles key press events and updates the API key when the 'Enter' key is pressed. It also uses an effect to focus on the input field when the key is being changed. The component renders either an input field for changing the key or a button to initiate the change, depending on the state.

### Usage & Examples

The components in the `components/Settings` directory are used to manage the application's settings. They are integral to the functionality of the chatbot-ui project, allowing users to customize their experience and interact with the chatbot in a seamless and efficient manner.

For example, the `SettingDialog` component is used to manage a settings dialog. It fetches the current settings using the `getSettings` utility function and allows the user to change the theme of the application. The new settings are saved using the `saveSettings` utility function. The component also handles outside clicks to close the dialog.

The `Import` component is used to provide an import functionality for the application. It renders an input of type 'file' and a `SidebarButton`. When the button is clicked, it triggers the file input click event to open the file picker. When a file is selected, it reads the file as text and parses it as JSON, then calls the `onImport` function with the parsed data.

The `Key` component is used to manage the API key settings for the application. It maintains a local state for the API key and a boolean flag to indicate whether the key is being changed. The component handles key press events and updates the API key when the 'Enter' key is pressed. It also uses an effect to focus on the input field when the key is being changed. The component renders either an input field for changing the key or a button to initiate the change, depending on the state.
