# __tests__ Directory Documentation

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the `chatbot-ui` project. It is an integral part of the project's commitment to maintaining high-quality code and ensuring the reliability of the application's features and functionalities. The directory is structured to facilitate the testing of various aspects of the application, with a particular focus on utility functions. The directory's structure and contents reflect the project's modular architecture, with each subdirectory corresponding to a specific aspect of the application.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains a single subdirectory named `utils`. This subdirectory serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within `utils`, there is another subdirectory named `app`, which contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`.

- `__tests__/utils`: A testing suite for utility functions within the application. It contains a subdirectory named `app`.
  - `__tests__/utils/app`: This subdirectory houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.
    - `__tests__/utils/app/importExports.test.ts`: A test file for utility functions related to import and export operations in the application.

## Key Components

The key component within the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file located in the `__tests__/utils/app` subdirectory. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house tests that validate various aspects of the `chatbot-ui` application. The tests within this directory are executed as part of the project's testing pipeline to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application's features and functionalities.

For instance, the `importExports.test.ts` file contains tests for different versions of the export format. These tests check whether a given object matches the expected format for each version. The file also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest format. The tests ensure that the cleaned data matches the expected structure of the latest format.

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {});
it('should return true for v1 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v1 formats', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV2', () => {});
it('should return true for v2 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v2 formats', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV3', () => {});
it('should return true for v3 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v3 formats', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV4', () => {});
it('should return true for v4 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v4 formats', () => {});
describe('cleanData Functions', () => {});
describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {});
it('should return the latest format', () => {});
describe('cleaning v2 data', () => {});
it('should return the latest format', () => {});
describe('cleaning v4 data', () => {});
it('should return the latest format', () => {});
```

This code snippet is a representative example of the tests contained within the `importExports.test.ts` file. It demonstrates the structure of the tests and the specific aspects of the application's import and export operations that are being tested.
