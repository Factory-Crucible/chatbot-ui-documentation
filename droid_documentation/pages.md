## Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a pivotal part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the repository for key files and a subdirectory that are integral to the functioning of the application. This directory is responsible for defining the main entry point for the home page, setting up the custom Document and App components for the Next.js application, and handling API requests and responses. The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory work in unison to provide a seamless user experience, manage state, handle API calls, and support internationalization.

### Contents

The `pages` directory is composed of three TypeScript files and an `api` subdirectory. 

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory.
- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.
- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api` subdirectory: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

The `pages` directory houses several critical files and subdirectories that contribute to the functionality of the chatbot-ui project.

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory, thereby playing a crucial role in rendering the home page.
- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization. This file is essential for defining the overall structure and layout of the application.
- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization. This file is key to initializing the application and setting up the necessary libraries.
- `api` subdirectory: This subdirectory is responsible for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and managing the 'home' page of the application. The files within this subdirectory play a crucial role in managing the interactions between the application and external APIs, and in managing the state and functionality of the home page.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used to define the structure and functionality of the application.

- `index.tsx`: This file is used to define the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory.

```typescript
export { default, getServerSideProps } from './api/home';
```

- `_document.tsx`: This file is used to define a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

```typescript
type Props = DocumentProps & {};
export default function Document(props: Props) {}
```

- `_app.tsx`: This file is used to define a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api` subdirectory: The files within this subdirectory are used to handle API requests and responses, interact with OpenAI and Google APIs, and manage the 'home' page of the application. For example, the `home.tsx` file in the `home` subdirectory defines a `Home` functional component and exports a `getServerSideProps` function for server-side rendering.

```typescript
interface Props {
  serverSideApiKeyIsSet: boolean;
  serverSidePluginKeysSet: boolean;
  defaultModelId: OpenAIModelID;
}

const Home = ({
  serverSideApiKeyIsSet,
  serverSidePluginKeysSet,
  defaultModelId,
}: Props) => {}

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async ({ locale }) => {};
```
