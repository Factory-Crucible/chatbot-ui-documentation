# `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot user interface. It currently contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component for the mobile application's navigation bar. This component, named 'Navbar', is a critical part of the mobile user interface, providing a way for users to navigate between different conversations in the chat application. The `Navbar` component is designed to be responsive and efficient, ensuring a smooth user experience on mobile devices.

## Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing a single TypeScript file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This file defines the `Navbar` component, which is used in the navigation bar of the mobile chat application. The component accepts two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`. The `selectedConversation` prop is an object of type `Conversation` representing the currently active chat, while the `onNewConversation` prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated.

## Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the `Navbar` component, which is a critical part of the mobile user interface. This component is responsible for displaying the currently active conversation and providing a way for users to initiate new conversations. It does this by displaying the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the `onNewConversation` function, allowing users to start a new conversation.

## Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot user interface. It is typically rendered at the top of the screen, providing a way for users to navigate between different conversations.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object of type `Conversation` representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started.

Please note that this is a simplified example and the actual usage of the `Navbar` component may vary depending on the specific requirements and context of the application.
