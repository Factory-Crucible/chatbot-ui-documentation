## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is a dedicated space for the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a crucial part of the user interface, providing a visual indication of loading states throughout the application. The Spinner component is a React component that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate that the application is processing data or waiting for a response. The directory contains two files: `Spinner.tsx` and `index.ts`, which together define and export the Spinner component.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. It is a React component that renders a spinner, typically used to indicate loading state in a user interface. The Spinner component accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop determines the height and width of the spinner, defaulting to '1em' if not provided. The 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner, defaulting to an empty string if not provided. The spinner is created using SVG and has an animation applied to it to create the spinning effect.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component. It exports the default export from the 'Spinner.tsx' file, which is the main Spinner component. This structure allows for cleaner imports elsewhere in the codebase, as one can import the Spinner component directly from 'components/Spinner' instead of having to specify the 'Spinner.tsx' file.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Spinner.tsx` file. This file defines the Spinner component, which is a critical part of the user interface. The Spinner component is used throughout the application to indicate loading states, providing a visual cue to the user that data is being processed or an operation is in progress. The Spinner component is highly customizable, with props for size and additional CSS classes, allowing it to be adapted to various contexts and styles within the application.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate loading states. It can be imported into any other component or module using the following import statement:

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';
```

Once imported, the Spinner component can be used in the JSX of a React component. For example, it could be used in a component that fetches data from an API, displaying the Spinner while the data is being fetched:

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

const DataFetchingComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    setData(data);
    setLoading(false);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {loading ? <Spinner /> : <div>{data}</div>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default DataFetchingComponent;
```

In this example, the Spinner is displayed while the data is being fetched from the API. Once the data has been fetched and the loading state is set to false, the Spinner is replaced with the fetched data.
