## Hooks Directory

The `hooks` directory is a specialized section of the codebase that houses custom React hooks. These hooks are designed to encapsulate and manage specific aspects of state and side effects within the chatbot-ui project. The directory contains two TypeScript files: `useCreateReducer.ts` and `useFetch.ts`. Each of these files defines a custom hook that provides a specific functionality, contributing to the overall functionality of the chatbot-ui project.

### Contents

The `hooks` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useCreateReducer`. This hook is designed to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. It also defines two TypeScript types: `FieldNames` and `ActionType`. These types are used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.
- `useFetch.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook for making HTTP requests. It defines two types, `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel`, to structure the request parameters. The `useFetch` hook returns an object with methods for each HTTP verb (get, post, put, patch, delete). Each method uses a helper function `handleFetch` to perform the actual fetch operation.

### Key Components

The `hooks` directory contains two key components:

- `useCreateReducer`: This custom hook is a critical part of the state management system in the chatbot-ui project. It provides a way to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state, ensuring type safety and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors. The `FieldNames` and `ActionType` types defined in this file are used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action, providing a structured and predictable way to manage state.
- `useFetch`: This custom hook is responsible for making HTTP requests within the chatbot-ui project. It provides a structured and consistent way to make requests and handle responses, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability. The `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel` types defined in this file provide a way to structure request parameters, ensuring that requests are made in a consistent and predictable manner.

### Usage & Examples

The hooks defined in the `hooks` directory are used throughout the chatbot-ui project to manage state and side effects.

- `useCreateReducer`: This hook is used to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. It is used in various parts of the project where state management is required. For example, it could be used to manage the state of a chat conversation, with the `initialState` being the initial state of the conversation and the `dispatch` action being used to update the state based on user input or API responses.
- `useFetch`: This hook is used to make HTTP requests. It is used in various parts of the project where API interactions are required. For example, it could be used to make a GET request to retrieve chatbot data, a POST request to send user input to the chatbot API, or a PUT request to update chatbot settings. The `handleFetch` helper function within `useFetch` constructs the request and handles the response, including error handling.
