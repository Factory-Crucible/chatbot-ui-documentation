## Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a critical component of the `chatbot-ui` project. It contains key files and a subdirectory that are essential for the functioning of the application. The files within this directory are responsible for defining the main entry point for the home page, setting up the custom Document and App components for the Next.js application, and handling API requests and responses. The `api` subdirectory further extends the functionality by providing specific endpoints for handling API requests related to OpenAI models, chat functionality, and Google APIs. It also contains files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Contents

The `pages` directory contains three TypeScript files and one subdirectory:

- `index.tsx`: This file serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the 'home' file in the 'api' subdirectory.
- `_document.tsx`: This file defines a custom Document for the Next.js application. It sets up an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.
- `_app.tsx`: This file defines a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api`: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, and contains files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

The `pages` directory contains several key components that are crucial to the functioning of the `chatbot-ui` project:

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, which are essential for rendering the home page.
- `_document.tsx`: This file defines a custom Document for the Next.js application. It sets up an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, which are necessary for the proper functioning of the application.
- `_app.tsx`: This file defines a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. This component is crucial for the initialization of pages and the setup of libraries in the application.
- `api`: This subdirectory contains files that handle API requests and responses. These files are essential for the interaction of the application with OpenAI and Google APIs.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used in various ways within the `chatbot-ui` project:

- `index.tsx`: This file is used as the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, which are used to render the home page.
- `_document.tsx`: This file is used to define a custom Document for the Next.js application. It sets up an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, which are used to render the application.
- `_app.tsx`: This file is used to define a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. This component is used to initialize pages and set up libraries in the application.
- `api`: This subdirectory is used to handle API requests and responses. The files within this subdirectory interact with OpenAI and Google APIs, and are used to handle API requests and responses.

For example, the `index.tsx` file exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the 'home' file in the 'api' subdirectory. These are used to render the home page of the application:

```typescript
export { default, getServerSideProps } from './api/home';
```

The `_document.tsx` file defines a custom Document for the Next.js application. It sets up an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, which are used to render the application:

```typescript
type Props = DocumentProps & {};
export default function Document(props: Props) {}
```

The `_app.tsx` file defines a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. This component is used to initialize pages and set up libraries in the application:

```typescript
function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps<{}>)
```

The `api` subdirectory contains files that handle API requests and responses. These files interact with OpenAI and Google APIs, and are used to handle API requests and responses. For example, the `chat.ts` file serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality:

```typescript
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};

const handler = async (req: Request): Promise<Response> => {
};

export default handler;
```
