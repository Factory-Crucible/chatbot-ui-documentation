# `pages` Directory

The `pages` directory is a pivotal part of the project, housing key files and a subdirectory that are integral to the functioning of the application. This directory is responsible for defining the main entry point for the home page, setting up the custom Document and App components for the Next.js application, and handling API requests and responses. The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory work in unison to provide a seamless user experience, manage state, and interact with external APIs.

## Contents

The `pages` directory contains three TypeScript files and an `api` subdirectory. The TypeScript files include `index.tsx`, `_document.tsx`, and `_app.tsx`, each serving a specific purpose in the application. The `api` subdirectory further contains files and subdirectories that handle API requests and responses, and manage the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

The `index.tsx` file serves as the main entry point for the home page, exporting a React component and a server-side rendering function. The `_document.tsx` file is a custom Document for the Next.js application, defining an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts. The `_app.tsx` file is a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.

The `api` subdirectory is a critical component of the `pages` directory, containing files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and managing the 'home' page of the application.

### Usage & Examples

The `index.tsx` file is used as the main entry point for the home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the 'home' file in the 'api' subdirectory. 

```typescript
export { default, getServerSideProps } from './api/home';
```

The `_document.tsx` file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines a 'Document' function that takes 'props' as a parameter, which is a combination of 'DocumentProps' and custom document properties. The function returns an HTML document structure with a 'lang' attribute set to the current locale.

```typescript
type Props = DocumentProps & {};
export default function Document(props: Props) {}
```

The `_app.tsx` file is a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.

The `api` subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and managing the 'home' page of the application. For instance, the `chat.ts` file serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality, processing requests, encoding messages, and interacting with an OpenAI service.

```typescript
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};

const handler = async (req: Request): Promise<Response> => {
};

export default handler;
```
