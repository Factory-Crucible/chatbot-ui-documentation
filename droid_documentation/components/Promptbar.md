## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the React application, housing TypeScript files and a subdirectory that collectively form the 'Promptbar' component. This component represents a sidebar in the user interface, with functionalities for managing prompts and folders. The 'Promptbar' component is exported from the `index.ts` file, which serves as the entry point for this directory.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory:

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: Defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: The main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: Defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.
- `index.ts`: The entry point, exporting the 'Promptbar' component.
- `components`: A subdirectory containing related components.

### Key Components

The `components/Promptbar` directory houses several key files:

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This TypeScript context file defines an interface 'PromptbarContextProps' which outlines the shape of the context, including the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts. The 'PromptbarContext' is created using React's 'createContext' function with the 'PromptbarContextProps' interface.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file for the 'Promptbar'. It uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects. It imports several other components and a context 'HomeContext' and a state 'Promptbar.state'. The 'Promptbar' component has several functions to handle actions like toggling the prompt bar, creating, deleting, and updating prompts.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component. It contains two main exports. The first is an interface named 'PromptbarInitialState' which outlines the structure of the initial state for the 'Promptbar' component. The second export is a constant object 'initialState' which implements the 'PromptbarInitialState' interface and sets the initial values for 'searchTerm' and 'filteredPrompts'.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to manage the 'Promptbar' component of the application. The 'Promptbar' component represents a sidebar in the user interface, with functionalities for managing prompts and folders.

For instance, the `PromptBar.context.tsx` file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. This context is used in other parts of the application to manage the state and behavior of the 'Promptbar' component.

The `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file for the 'Promptbar'. It uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects. It imports several other components and a context 'HomeContext' and a state 'Promptbar.state'. The 'Promptbar' component has several functions to handle actions like toggling the prompt bar, creating, deleting, and updating prompts.

The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component. This state is used in the 'Promptbar' component to manage its state and behavior.

The `components` subdirectory contains several related components that are used in the 'Promptbar' component. These components handle various aspects of the 'Promptbar' component, such as rendering a list of prompts, managing the settings of the 'Promptbar', handling the actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, rendering a modal for editing prompts, and managing the display and functionality of folders within the 'Promptbar'.
