Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It is generated and maintained by the Documentation Droid, ensuring that it remains up-to-date as the codebase evolves.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is dedicated to the development of a chatbot user interface (UI). This UI is designed to interact with various AI models, providing a platform for users to communicate with these models in a conversational manner. The repository is a part of a larger ecosystem, interacting with other services to provide a comprehensive chatbot solution.

### Technologies Used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies. It is primarily built using TypeScript and ReactJS, a popular combination for developing robust and scalable web applications. The project also utilizes Docker for containerization, ensuring that the application runs consistently across different environments. Other significant technologies include Kubernetes for orchestration, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Major Components

The codebase is divided into several major components. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different functionality of the chatbot UI. The 'pages' directory contains key files that serve as the entry points to the codebase. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations.

### Conventions

The codebase follows certain conventions for consistency and readability. File naming follows the camelCase convention, with '.ts' or '.tsx' extensions for TypeScript files. Directories are named in lowercase, with hyphens separating words. Test files are located in the '**tests**' directory and follow the '.test.ts' naming convention.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. The root directory contains configuration files for the project, Docker, and various tools. It also includes a Dockerfile for creating a Docker image and a 'docker-compose.yml' for defining and managing the Docker application. The 'public' directory contains branding files and a 'screenshots' subdirectory. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, while the 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The '**tests**' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

The structure of the codebase can be visualized as follows:

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the interaction between the user and the chatbot UI. The user inputs a message, which is processed and sent to the appropriate AI model via the OpenAI API. The model generates a response, which is then displayed in the chat UI. This flow is managed by the 'Chat' and 'Chatbar' components, with the 'useApiService' hook handling the API calls.

The 'Promptbar' component manages prompts and folders, providing a sidebar in the UI for users to manage their prompts and folders. The 'Settings' component allows users to change the application theme and manage API keys.

The 'pages/api' directory handles API requests and responses, interacting with the OpenAI and Google APIs to generate prompts and send responses.

For a more in-depth understanding of these flows, refer to the following documentation files:

- [`Chat.md`](components/Chat.md)
- [`Chatbar.md`](components/Chatbar.md)
- [`Promptbar.md`](components/Promptbar.md)
- [`Settings.md`](components/Settings.md)
- [`pages.md`](pages.md)

### System Connections

The system interacts with external services such as the OpenAI API and the Google Custom Search API. The 'useApiService' hook in the 'services' directory manages these interactions, making POST requests to the '/api/models' endpoint for the OpenAI API and handling responses.

The 'pages/api' directory also interacts with these external services, processing requests, encoding messages, and interacting with the OpenAI and Google APIs.

For more information on these interactions, refer to the following documentation files:

- [`services.md`](services.md)
- [`pages.md`](pages.md)

## Testing Principles

The '**tests**' directory is dedicated to testing within the project. It contains a 'utils' subdirectory, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. The 'importExports.test.ts' file validates the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version.

For more information on testing principles, refer to the following documentation file:

- [`__tests__.md`](__tests__.md)
