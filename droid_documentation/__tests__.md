# __tests__ Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the `chatbot-ui` project. It is structured to reflect the organization of the codebase, with subdirectories corresponding to the different areas of the application. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within `utils`, there's another subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- `utils`: This subdirectory serves as a testing suite for the utility functions within the application. It contains a subdirectory named `app`, which houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.

### __tests__/utils

The `utils` subdirectory within the `__tests__` directory is a testing suite for utility functions within the application. It contains a subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations. This file ensures that exported objects align with the expected format for each version and tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one. The test checks that the updated data matches the expected structure of the current format.

#### Contents

The `utils` subdirectory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- `app`: This subdirectory contains test files for the application's utility functions. Specifically, it includes a file named `importExports.test.ts`.

### __tests__/utils/app

The `app` subdirectory within the `utils` directory contains test files for the application's utility functions. Specifically, it includes a file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file tests utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It verifies different versions of the export format, ensuring that a given object matches the expected format for each version. The file also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest one, and checks that the cleaned data aligns with the expected structure of the latest format.

#### Contents

The `app` subdirectory contains the following file:

- `importExports.test.ts`: This is a test file for utility functions related to import and export operations in the application.

## Key Components

The key component in the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file. This file tests the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the exported objects conform to the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house all the test suites for the application. Each subdirectory corresponds to a different area of the application, and the test files within these subdirectories test the functionality of that area.

For example, the `importExports.test.ts` file within the `app` subdirectory of `utils` tests the import and export operations of the application. It contains several test suites, each corresponding to a different version of the export format. Each test suite contains tests that check whether a given object matches the expected format for that version. The file also contains a test suite for the `cleanData` function, which checks whether data from older export formats is correctly updated to the latest format.

Here is a simplified example of what the structure of the `importExports.test.ts` file might look like:

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {
    it('should return true for v1 format', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
    it('should return false for non-v1 formats', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
  });
  // More test suites for other versions here
  describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
    describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {
      it('should return the latest format', () => {
        // Test code here
      });
    });
    // More test suites for other versions here
  });
});
```

This structure allows for comprehensive testing of the import and export operations, ensuring that the application can correctly handle data in all supported formats.
