Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the codebase and the documentation. These docs are generated and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes by the Documentation Droid.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is dedicated to the development of a chatbot user interface. This repository is part of a larger system where it interacts with other services to provide a comprehensive chatbot experience.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on technologies such as Docker, Node.js, TypeScript, React, and Kubernetes. It also uses various tools like Makefile, Prettier, PostCSS, and Tailwind CSS for development and deployment purposes.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, while the 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The '**tests**' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

### Conventions

The codebase follows certain conventions. File naming follows a clear and consistent pattern, making it easy to locate and understand the purpose of each file. The codebase also adheres to the principles of modular design, with each directory and file having a specific purpose.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into directories, each serving a specific purpose. The root directory contains configuration files for the project, Docker, and various tools. It also includes a Dockerfile for creating a Docker image and a 'docker-compose.yml' for defining and managing the Docker application. The 'package.json' file lists the project's dependencies and scripts. The project uses TypeScript, with the 'tsconfig.json' file configuring the TypeScript compiler.

The 'public' directory contains branding files and a 'screenshots' subdirectory. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, while the 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The '**tests**' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

The structure of the codebase can be visualized as follows:

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase involve the interaction between various components, utilities, and services. For example, the 'Chat' component manages the chat functionality, while the 'Chatbar' component represents the chat bar, with handlers for various actions like changing API keys and managing conversations. The 'useFetch' hook in the 'utils' directory is used for making HTTP requests, and the 'errorService' in the 'services' directory provides localized error messages.

The 'api' subdirectory in the 'pages' directory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs. For a more in-depth understanding of these flows, refer to the respective documentation files in the directory: [`api.md`](pages.md), [`Chat.md`](components/Chat.md), [`Chatbar.md`](components/Chatbar.md), [`useFetch.md`](utils.md), and [`errorService.md`](services.md).

### System Connections

The system interacts with external services like OpenAI and Google APIs. The 'models.ts' file in the 'api' directory handles requests related to OpenAI models, constructing URLs and fetching data from the OpenAI API. The 'google.ts' file handles API requests and responses, interacting with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API to generate prompts and send responses. For more details, refer to the `models.md` and `google.md` documentation files.

## Testing Principles

The '**tests**' directory is dedicated to testing within the project. It contains a subdirectory named 'utils', which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. The 'importExports.test.ts' file in the 'app' subdirectory validates the functionality of import and export operations. For more details on testing principles, refer to the [`__tests__.md`](__tests__.md) documentation file.
