## `components/Search` Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a crucial part of the `chatbot-ui` project, serving as the home for the `Search` component. This component is a functional React component written in TypeScript, designed to provide a search input field for the user interface. It accepts three props: `placeholder`, `searchTerm`, and `onSearch`. The `placeholder` is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The `searchTerm` is the current search term, and `onSearch` is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the `searchTerm` and calls `onSearch` when its value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input when clicked. 

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two main files: `Search.tsx` and `index.ts`. 

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that exports a functional component named `Search`. It defines the structure and behavior of the `Search` component, including its props and the rendering of the input field and 'X' icon.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the `Search` directory, exporting the default export from `Search.tsx`. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory.

### Key Components

The `Search.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the `Search` component, which is a functional React component that provides a search input field for the user interface. This component is crucial for enabling users to search within the chatbot UI, providing a seamless and efficient user experience.

### Usage & Examples

The `Search` component is used in various parts of the `chatbot-ui` project where a search input field is required. It is a reusable component that can be imported from the `components/Search` directory and used with different props to customize its behavior.

For example, it can be used in a parent component as follows:

```typescript
import Search from 'components/Search';

// ...

<Search
  placeholder="Search..."
  searchTerm={currentSearchTerm}
  onSearch={updateSearchTerm}
/>
```

In this example, `currentSearchTerm` is a state variable that holds the current search term, and `updateSearchTerm` is a function that updates this state variable. The `placeholder` prop is set to "Search...", which is displayed when the search input is empty.
