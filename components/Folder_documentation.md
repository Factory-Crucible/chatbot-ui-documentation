## `components/Folder` Directory

The `components/Folder` directory is a part of the `integration-chatbot-ui` project's modular architecture. This directory is dedicated to housing the `Folder` component, which is a critical part of the user interface. The `Folder` component is responsible for rendering interactive elements related to folders, such as buttons for renaming and deleting folders. It also displays the `folderComponent` when the `isOpen` state variable is set to true.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two files:

- `index.ts`: This TypeScript index file exports the `Folder` component from the `Folder.tsx` file. It does not contain any other code or logic.

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that defines the `Folder` component. It imports various icons, hooks, and other components. The `Folder` component accepts several props and uses the `useState` hook to manage state variables. It also defines several functions for handling user interactions.

### Folder Structure Overview

The `components/Folder` directory follows a simple structure with two files. The `index.ts` file serves as an entry point, exporting the `Folder` component defined in the `Folder.tsx` file. The `Folder.tsx` file contains the actual implementation of the `Folder` component, including its state management and user interaction handlers.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Folder` component defined in the `Folder.tsx` file. This component is crucial for rendering interactive elements related to folders in the user interface. Here is a brief overview of its structure:

- Props: The `Folder` component accepts several props, including `currentFolder`, `searchTerm`, `handleDrop`, and `folderComponent`.

- State: The component uses the `useState` hook to manage several state variables, such as `isDeleting`, `isRenaming`, `renameValue`, and `isOpen`.

- Functions: The component defines several functions for handling user interactions, including `handleEnterDown`, `handleRename`, `dropHandler`, `allowDrop`, `highlightDrop`, and `removeHighlight`.

- Rendering: The component renders a div with various interactive elements, including buttons for renaming and deleting folders. It also displays the `folderComponent` when the `isOpen` state variable is true.

You can find more detailed information about the `Folder` component in its [dedicated documentation](./components/Folder/Folder.md).

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the codebase to render interactive elements related to folders. It is typically used in the context of a parent component that manages a collection of folders.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Folder` component might be used:

```jsx
import Folder from './components/Folder';

function ParentComponent() {
  const folders = getFolders(); // Assume this function fetches the folders
  const handleDrop = (e, folder) => {
    // Handle the drop event
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {folders.map((folder) => (
        <Folder
          key={folder.id}
          currentFolder={folder}
          handleDrop={handleDrop}
          folderComponent={<FolderContents folder={folder} />}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `ParentComponent` renders a `Folder` component for each folder. It passes the `handleDrop` function and a `FolderContents` component as props to the `Folder` component.
