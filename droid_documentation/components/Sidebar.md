## components/Sidebar

The `components/Sidebar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It houses the TypeScript files that define the Sidebar component and its functionalities. The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The directory also includes a subdirectory, `components/Sidebar/components`, which contains additional component files for managing the sidebar.

### Contents

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point, exporting the main Sidebar component from `Sidebar.tsx`.
- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `components/Sidebar/components`: This subdirectory contains additional component files for managing the sidebar, including `OpenCloseButton.tsx`, which exports two components responsible for opening and closing the sidebar.

### Key Components

- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `components/Sidebar/components/OpenCloseButton.tsx`: This file exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are responsible for opening and closing the sidebar, respectively.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Sidebar` directory are used to manage the sidebar of the chatbot UI. The Sidebar component, defined in `Sidebar.tsx`, is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization.

The `SidebarButton.tsx` file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. This button is used in the sidebar for various actions.

The `components/Sidebar/components/OpenCloseButton.tsx` file exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are used to open and close the sidebar in the user interface. Both components accept two props: 'onClick', a function that is triggered when the button is clicked, and 'side', a string that can be either 'left' or 'right', indicating the side of the screen where the sidebar is located.
