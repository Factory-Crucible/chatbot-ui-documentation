## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is a part of the `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project, including the Sidebar, Settings, Buttons, Chatbar, Chat, Markdown, Folder, Spinner, Promptbar, Search, and Mobile components. Each of these components is responsible for a specific part of the user interface and functionality of the chatbot. The `components/Spinner` directory specifically contains the files related to the Spinner React component. This component is used to display a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The directory contains two files: `Spinner.tsx` and `index.ts`.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component, which displays a spinning animation typically used to indicate a loading state. It accepts 'size' and 'className' as optional props, with 'size' controlling the spinner's dimensions and 'className' allowing for additional CSS classes. The spinner is created using SVG and includes an animation for the spinning effect.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component, exporting the default export from 'Spinner.tsx'. This setup simplifies imports elsewhere in the project, as the Spinner component can be imported directly from 'components/Spinner' without specifying the 'Spinner.tsx' file.

The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Key Components

The key components of the `components/Spinner` directory are the two TypeScript files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file is crucial as it defines the Spinner component, which is a fundamental part of the user interface. The Spinner component is used across the application to indicate loading states, making it a critical part of the user experience. The file defines the component's structure, its props, and the SVG used to create the spinning animation.
- `index.ts`: This file is important as it serves as the entry point for the Spinner component. By exporting the default export from 'Spinner.tsx', it simplifies the import process elsewhere in the project. This file contributes to the maintainability and readability of the codebase.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component, defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file, is used throughout the codebase to indicate loading states. It is typically used in asynchronous operations where the application needs to wait for a response, such as API calls or data fetching operations.

The Spinner component can be imported into other components or files using the following import statement:

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';
```

Once imported, the Spinner component can be used in the JSX of a React component. The 'size' and 'className' props can be passed to customize the spinner's dimensions and CSS classes, respectively. For example:

```typescript
<Spinner size="2em" className="custom-spinner" />
```

In this example, the Spinner component is rendered with a size of '2em' and a CSS class of 'custom-spinner'. If no 'size' or 'className' props are provided, the Spinner component defaults to a size of '1em' and an empty string for the 'className' prop.
