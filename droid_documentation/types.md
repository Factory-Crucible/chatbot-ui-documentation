## Types Directory

The `types` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. It contains TypeScript files that define various interfaces, types, and constants used throughout the project. These definitions provide a consistent structure for data across the codebase, ensuring that all components and modules interact with data in a predictable and reliable manner. The types defined in this directory cover a wide range of functionalities, from theme settings and key-value pair structures to chat systems and OpenAI models.

### Contents

The `types` directory contains several TypeScript files, each serving a specific purpose. There are no subdirectories within this directory. The files in this directory include:

- `data.ts`: Defines a key-value pair structure.
- `prompt.ts`: Outlines a prompt object.
- `plugin.ts`: Defines structures for plugins and their keys.
- `settings.ts`: Defines theme settings.
- `storage.ts`: Defines the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.
- `openai.ts`: Defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers.
- `chat.ts`: Defines various interfaces and types related to a chat system.
- `export.ts`: Defines various types and interfaces related to the export functionality of the application.
- `google.ts`: Structures data related to Google's services.
- `folder.ts`: Defines a 'Folder' object.
- `index.ts`: An empty placeholder file.
- `env.ts`: Represents environment variables for the OpenAI API.
- `error.ts`: Structures error messages.

### Key Components

Several files in the `types` directory play a critical role in the functioning of the chatbot-ui project:

- `data.ts`: This file defines the 'KeyValuePair' interface, which is likely used throughout the project wherever a key-value pair structure is needed.
- `prompt.ts`: This file defines the 'Prompt' interface, providing a consistent structure for prompt objects throughout the codebase.
- `plugin.ts`: This file defines the structure and data for plugins in the application, including interfaces for a plugin and its key, enums for plugin identification and naming, and a record of all plugins.
- `storage.ts`: This file defines the structure of the local storage schema for a chatbot UI, including properties for an API key, conversation history, selected conversation, theme, folders, prompts, visibility of chat and prompt bars, and plugin keys.
- `openai.ts`: This file primarily defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers, including an interface for an OpenAI model, an enum for model identifiers, a default model identifier, and a record mapping model identifiers to their respective model details.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `types` directory are used throughout the codebase to provide a consistent structure for data. For instance, the 'KeyValuePair' interface defined in `data.ts` is likely used wherever a key-value pair structure is needed. Similarly, the 'Prompt' interface defined in `prompt.ts` provides a consistent structure for prompt objects throughout the codebase.

The `plugin.ts` file defines the structure and data for plugins in the application. It includes interfaces for a plugin and its key, enums for plugin identification and naming, and a record of all plugins. This structure is likely used wherever plugins are managed in the application.

The `storage.ts` file defines the structure of the local storage schema for a chatbot UI. This structure is likely used wherever local storage is accessed or manipulated in the application.

The `openai.ts` file primarily defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers. This structure is likely used wherever OpenAI models are used in the application, such as when making API requests to the OpenAI API.

The `chat.ts` file defines various interfaces and types related to a chat system. These definitions are likely used wherever chat messages are managed in the application.

The `export.ts` file defines various types and interfaces related to the export functionality of the application. These definitions are likely used wherever data is exported from the application.

The `google.ts` file structures data related to Google's services. This structure is likely used wherever the application interacts with Google's APIs.

The `folder.ts` file defines a 'Folder' object. This object is likely used wherever folders are managed in the application.

The `env.ts` file represents environment variables for the OpenAI API. These variables are likely used wherever the application makes API requests to the OpenAI API.

The `error.ts` file structures error messages. These structures are likely used wherever errors are handled in the application.
