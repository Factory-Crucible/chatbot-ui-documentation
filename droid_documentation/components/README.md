# Directory Overview: components

The `components` directory is a central part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. It houses the React components that collectively form the user interface of the chatbot application. Each subdirectory within `components` corresponds to a specific feature or functionality of the chatbot UI, such as the chat interface, settings dialog, sidebar, and more. These components are designed to be modular and reusable, promoting a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Contents

The `components` directory is a collection of subdirectories, each dedicated to a specific part of the chatbot UI. For instance, the `Markdown` subdirectory handles markdown rendering within the chatbot UI, enhancing the user experience by displaying rich text content and code snippets. The `Buttons` subdirectory houses the button components used throughout the user interface, triggering various functionalities when clicked. The `Search` subdirectory is responsible for providing a search functionality within the user interface. The `Settings` subdirectory houses the logic and structure for managing the application's settings. The `Chat` subdirectory forms the chat interface of the application, rendering chat messages, managing the chat input, handling system prompts, and providing various controls and settings for the chat interface. The `Chatbar` subdirectory manages the chat bar in the chatbot UI, handling user input, sending messages, and managing various controls and settings. The `Spinner` subdirectory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project, a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The `Sidebar` subdirectory houses the logic and structure for the sidebar, a key component of the user interface. The `Promptbar` subdirectory serves as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application, a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. The `Folder` subdirectory is specifically designed to represent a folder in a file system within the user interface. The `Mobile` subdirectory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application.

## Structure

The `components` directory is structured into several subdirectories, each serving a specific purpose. Here is a high-level overview of the subdirectories and their roles:

- [`Markdown`](Markdown.md): Handles markdown rendering within the chatbot UI.
- [`Buttons`](Buttons.md): Houses the button components used throughout the user interface.
- [`Search`](Search.md): Provides a search functionality within the user interface.
- [`Settings`](Settings.md): Manages the application's settings.
- [`Chat`](Chat.md): Forms the chat interface of the application.
- [`Chatbar`](Chatbar.md): Manages the chat bar in the chatbot UI.
- [`Spinner`](Spinner.md): Houses the Spinner component, a visual element that displays a spinning animation.
- [`Sidebar`](Sidebar.md): Houses the logic and structure for the sidebar.
- [`Promptbar`](Promptbar.md): Serves as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application.
- [`Folder`](Folder.md): Represents a folder in a file system within the user interface.
- [`Mobile`](Mobile.md): Dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application.

Each subdirectory contains a detailed documentation that provides an in-depth understanding of the component's structure, contents, key components, and usage examples. To learn more about a specific component, click on its name to navigate to its detailed documentation.
