## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The Spinner component is a crucial part of the user experience, providing feedback to the user when an operation is in progress and preventing confusion or frustration that might arise from unresponsive controls.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. It is a React component that renders an SVG-based spinner animation. The component accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop controls the dimensions of the spinner, while the 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component, exporting the default export from `Spinner.tsx`. This setup simplifies imports elsewhere in the project, as the Spinner component can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` without specifying the `Spinner.tsx` file.

The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the Spinner component, defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file. This component is a critical part of the user interface, providing a visual indication of loading states. The Spinner component is designed to be flexible and reusable, with optional props for size and additional CSS classes. This flexibility allows the Spinner component to be used in various parts of the application, adapting to different contexts and styles.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate loading states. Whenever an operation is in progress, such as an API request or a data processing task, the Spinner component can be rendered to provide visual feedback to the user.

Here is a simplified example of how the Spinner component might be used in a React component:

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate an asynchronous operation
    setTimeout(() => {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }, 2000);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? <Spinner size="2em" className="text-blue-500" /> : 'Content loaded'}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

In this example, the `ExampleComponent` initially displays the Spinner component. After a simulated asynchronous operation completes (represented by a timeout), the component's state is updated, and the Spinner is replaced with the text 'Content loaded'.
