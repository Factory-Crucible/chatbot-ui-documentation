Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the repository, including its purpose, technologies used, major components, conventions, structure, main flows, and testing principles. These docs are generated and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes by the Documentation Droid.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to provide a user interface for a chatbot application. It is a Docker-based Node.js project that uses TypeScript for static typing. The repository is part of a larger system, interacting with other services to provide a complete chatbot solution.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies. It uses Node.js as the runtime environment and TypeScript for static typing. The project uses React for building the user interface and Next.js for server-side rendering. For styling, it uses Tailwind CSS and PostCSS. The project also uses Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different aspect of the user interface. The 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The '**tests**' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

### Conventions

The codebase follows several conventions. File naming follows the convention of using camelCase for JavaScript and TypeScript files. Directory names are in lowercase. Test files are named after the file they are testing, with the addition of '.test' before the file extension.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. Some directories contain a significant amount of code, while others contain static assets and are rarely utilized. Here is a high-level overview of the directory structure:

```
.
├── __tests__
├── components
├── droid_documentation
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
├── public
├── services
├── styles
├── types
└── utils
```

For a more detailed overview of each directory, please refer to the respective markdown files in the 'droid_documentation' directory.

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the chatbot UI. The 'pages' directory serves as the entry point, with 'index.tsx' rendering the home page. The 'Chat' component in the 'components' directory handles the chat functionality. The 'Chatbar' component manages the chat bar and its context. The 'Promptbar' component manages prompts and folders. The 'api' subdirectory in the 'pages' directory handles API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs.

For a more in-depth understanding of the main flows, please refer to the ['pages.md'](./pages.md) and ['components/README.md'](./components/README.md) documentation files.

### System Connections

The codebase interacts with external systems, specifically the OpenAI and Google APIs. The 'api' subdirectory in the 'pages' directory contains files for handling these API requests and responses. The 'models.ts' file handles requests related to OpenAI models, and the 'chat.ts' file serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality, processing requests and interacting with an OpenAI service. The 'google.ts' file interacts with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API to generate prompts and send responses.

## Testing Principles

The '**tests**' directory is dedicated to testing in the project. It contains a subdirectory named 'utils', which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. The 'importExports.test.ts' file validates the functionality of import and export operations. It ensures that exported objects align with the expected format for each version and tests the 'cleanData' function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

For more details on testing principles, please refer to the ['**tests**.md'](./__tests__.md) documentation file.
