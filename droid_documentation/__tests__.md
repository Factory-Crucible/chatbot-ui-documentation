# `__tests__` Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in this project. It is structured to mirror the main codebase, allowing for a clear and organized approach to testing. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within `utils`, there's another subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- `utils`: This subdirectory serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. It contains a subdirectory named `app`.
  
  - `app`: This subdirectory houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.
    
    - `importExports.test.ts`: This is a test file for utility functions related to import and export operations in the application.

## Key Components

The `__tests__` directory contains several key components:

- `importExports.test.ts`: This file tests the import and export operations of the application. It verifies that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version and tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

## Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house tests for the application. The structure of the directory mirrors the main codebase, allowing for a clear and organized approach to testing. For example, the `importExports.test.ts` file in the `app` subdirectory tests the import and export operations of the application. It verifies that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version and tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  // Tests for different versions of the export format
});

describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
  // Tests for the 'cleanData' function
});
```

This example shows the structure of the `importExports.test.ts` file. It contains a series of tests for different versions of the export format and the `cleanData` function. The tests ensure that the exported objects and the cleaned data match the expected formats.
