## Hooks Directory

The Hooks directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses two TypeScript files that define custom React hooks, `useCreateReducer.ts` and `useFetch.ts`. These hooks play a significant role in the application's state management and HTTP request handling, respectively. The hooks are designed to be reusable and are used throughout the codebase to ensure consistency and maintainability.

### Contents

The Hooks directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useCreateReducer` that creates a typed reducer with dispatch and state. It also defines two TypeScript types, `FieldNames` and `ActionType`, which are used for managing the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.

- `useFetch.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named `useFetch` for making HTTP requests. It defines two types, `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel`, to structure the request parameters. The hook provides methods for each HTTP verb (get, post, put, patch, delete), and uses a helper function `handleFetch` to perform the actual fetch operation.

### Key Components

The Hooks directory contains two key components:

- `useCreateReducer`: This custom hook is a critical part of the application's state management. It creates a typed reducer with dispatch and state, ensuring type safety and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors. The hook uses `useReducer` and `useMemo` from React to manage state and optimize performance.

- `useFetch`: This custom hook is responsible for making HTTP requests throughout the application. It provides methods for each HTTP verb, and uses a helper function `handleFetch` to construct the request and handle the response, including error handling. This hook ensures consistency in how HTTP requests are made and handled across the application.

### Usage & Examples

The hooks defined in this directory are used throughout the codebase:

- `useCreateReducer`: This hook is used whenever a reducer is needed in the application. It takes an object with an `initialState` property as an argument, and returns a reducer function along with its dispatch function. The reducer function can then be used to manage state in a React component.

- `useFetch`: This hook is used for making HTTP requests. It returns an object with methods for each HTTP verb. These methods can be used to make HTTP requests in a consistent and error-handled manner. For example, the `get` method can be used to make a GET request to a specified URL with optional request parameters, headers, and an abort signal.
