Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. The documentation is generated and maintained by the Documentation Droid, ensuring that it remains up-to-date as the codebase evolves.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is dedicated to the development of a chatbot user interface (UI). The chatbot UI is a key component of our larger system, interacting with various services to provide a seamless user experience.

### Technologies Used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies, including:

- Docker: Used for creating a consistent and reproducible environment for the application.
- Node.js: The primary runtime environment for the application.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript, enhancing code quality and understandability.
- ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
- Kubernetes: Used for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components:

- Frontend Library: Contains React components for building the chatbot UI.
- Backend Library: Handles server-side operations, including API requests and responses.
- CLI: Provides command-line interfaces for various tasks.

### Conventions

The codebase follows certain conventions for better readability and maintainability. These include specific file naming conventions and structured organization of directories and files.

## Structure

The codebase is organized into various directories, each serving a specific purpose. Some directories contain a significant amount of code, while others house static assets and are rarely utilized. The structure of the codebase is outlined below:

```
.
├── __tests__
├── components
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
├── public
├── services
├── styles
├── types
└── utils
```

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The codebase contains several main flows that are crucial to understanding its operation. These flows include user interactions, data flow from one end of the system to the other, and interactions with external services. For a more in-depth understanding of these flows, refer to the respective documentation files in the directory.

### System Connections

The codebase interacts with several internal and external systems. These interactions are crucial for understanding the dependencies and the overall operation of the codebase. The codebase interacts with services like OpenAI and Google APIs for various functionalities.

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows certain testing principles to ensure the quality and reliability of the code. The main types of tests include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. The '**tests**' directory is dedicated to testing within the project. For more details, refer to the [`__tests__.md`](./__tests__.md) file.
