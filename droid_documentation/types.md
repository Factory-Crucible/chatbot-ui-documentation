## types

The `types` directory is a crucial part of the codebase, serving as the central location for TypeScript definitions that are used throughout the project. These definitions include interfaces, types, and constants that provide structure and consistency to the data used in the application. The directory contains several TypeScript files, each defining a specific aspect of the project. These files include `data.ts`, `prompt.ts`, `plugin.ts`, `settings.ts`, `storage.ts`, `openai.ts`, `chat.ts`, `export.ts`, `google.ts`, `folder.ts`, `index.ts`, and `env.ts`. Each of these files contributes to the overall structure and functionality of the project by defining key elements such as key-value pairs, prompts, plugins, settings, storage schema, OpenAI models, chat systems, export formats, Google services, folders, and environment variables.

### Contents

The `types` directory contains the following files:

- `data.ts`: Defines a key-value pair structure.
- `prompt.ts`: Outlines a prompt object.
- `plugin.ts`: Defines structures for plugins and chat systems.
- `settings.ts`: Defines theme settings.
- `storage.ts`: Defines the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.
- `openai.ts`: Defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers.
- `chat.ts`: Defines various interfaces and types related to a chat system.
- `export.ts`: Defines various types and interfaces related to the export functionality of the application.
- `google.ts`: Structures data related to Google's services.
- `folder.ts`: Defines a 'Folder' object.
- `index.ts`: An empty placeholder file.
- `env.ts`: Represents environment variables for the OpenAI API.

### Key Components

The `types` directory contains several key components that are critical to the functionality of the project. These include:

- `data.ts`: This file defines a key-value pair structure, which is likely used throughout the project wherever a key-value pair structure is needed.
- `prompt.ts`: This file outlines a prompt object, providing a consistent structure for prompt objects throughout the codebase.
- `plugin.ts`: This file defines the structure and data for plugins in the application, including the structure of a plugin and its key, plugin identification and naming, and a record of all plugins.
- `storage.ts`: This file defines the local storage schema for a chatbot UI, including properties for an API key, conversation history, selected conversation, theme, folders, prompts, visibility of chat and prompt bars, and plugin keys.
- `openai.ts`: This file defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers, including the properties of an OpenAI model and the identifiers for different OpenAI models.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `types` directory are used throughout the codebase to provide structure and consistency to the data used in the application. For example, the `KeyValuePair` interface defined in `data.ts` is likely used wherever a key-value pair structure is needed. Similarly, the `Prompt` interface defined in `prompt.ts` is likely used to provide a consistent structure for prompt objects throughout the codebase.

The `Plugin` interface and related types and constants defined in `plugin.ts` are likely used to manage plugins in the application. The `LocalStorage` interface defined in `storage.ts` is likely used to manage the local storage schema for the chatbot UI. The `OpenAIModel` interface and related types and constants defined in `openai.ts` are likely used to manage OpenAI models and their identifiers.

The `Message`, `Role`, `ChatBody`, and `Conversation` interfaces defined in `chat.ts` are likely used to manage chat messages and conversations in the application. The `SupportedExportFormats`, `LatestExportFormat`, and related interfaces defined in `export.ts` are likely used to manage the export functionality of the application. The `GoogleBody`, `GoogleResponse`, and `GoogleSource` interfaces defined in `google.ts` are likely used to manage interactions with Google's services. The `FolderInterface` and `FolderType` defined in `folder.ts` are likely used to manage folders in the application. The `ProcessEnv` interface defined in `env.ts` is likely used to manage environment variables for the OpenAI API.
