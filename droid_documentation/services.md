## Services Directory

The `services` directory is a critical part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses two TypeScript files that define custom React hooks, `useErrorService` and `useApiService`. These hooks play a significant role in the application's functionality, providing localized error messages and making API calls respectively. The `services` directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Contents

The `services` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named `useErrorService` that provides localized error messages using the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next`. The hook returns a function `getModelsError` that takes an error object and returns an `ErrorMessage` object with a title, status code, and list of messages. The title and messages are translated using the `useTranslation` hook.
- `useApiService.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useApiService` that uses another custom hook `useFetch` to make API calls. The hook provides a function `getModels` which makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint. The function accepts an object of type `GetModelsRequestProps` and an optional `AbortSignal` as parameters.

### Key Components

The `services` directory contains two key TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: The `useErrorService` hook defined in this file is crucial for providing localized error messages to the user. It uses the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next` to translate error messages, ensuring that users receive error messages in their preferred language. This enhances the user experience and makes the application more accessible.
- `useApiService.ts`: The `useApiService` hook defined in this file is responsible for making API calls to the `/api/models` endpoint. It uses the `useFetch` hook to make these calls, abstracting the complexity of fetch operations and making the code more readable and maintainable. This hook is essential for fetching model data from the server, which is a key part of the application's functionality.

### Usage & Examples

The hooks defined in the `services` directory are used throughout the codebase to provide localized error messages and make API calls.

- `useErrorService`: This hook is used whenever an error message needs to be displayed to the user. For example, if an API call fails, the `useErrorService` hook can be used to get a localized error message that can be displayed to the user.
- `useApiService`: This hook is used to make API calls to the `/api/models` endpoint. For example, when the application needs to fetch model data from the server, it can use the `getModels` function provided by the `useApiService` hook.

Please note that the code snippets provided in the `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE` are not representative of typical usage patterns. They are skeleton code snippets that provide a high-level overview of the structure of the hooks.
