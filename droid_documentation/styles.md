## Styles Directory

The `styles` directory is a dedicated space for the global styling of the project. It houses a single file, `globals.css`, which is instrumental in defining the look and feel of the entire application. This file is responsible for importing the necessary components from the Tailwind CSS framework and applying custom styles to certain elements. The `styles` directory does not contain any subdirectories, emphasizing its singular focus on global styling.

### Contents

The `styles` directory contains one file:

- `globals.css`: This is a CSS file that holds the global styles for the project. It imports base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework and includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. The file also sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade. It contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Additionally, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Key Components

The `globals.css` file is the key component in this directory. It serves as the central location for defining the global styles of the project. The file is responsible for importing the necessary components from the Tailwind CSS framework, which is a utility-first CSS framework. This allows for a more efficient and maintainable approach to styling. The file also contains custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, providing a consistent and visually appealing scrollbar across different web browsers. It also includes a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, ensuring the application is responsive and user-friendly on smaller screens.

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file is used to define the global styles for the project. It is loaded by the Next.js application and applied to the entire project. The file is written in CSS, a language that describes the style of an HTML document. Here is an example of how the file might be used:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss/base';
@import 'tailwindcss/components';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';

html {
  background-color: #1a202c;
}

@media (max-width: 720px) {
  pre {
    width: 90%;
  }
}

pre > div.codeblock {
  padding: 0;
}
```

In this example, the file first imports the necessary components from the Tailwind CSS framework. It then sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade. It includes a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Lastly, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.
