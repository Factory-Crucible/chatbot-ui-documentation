## Types Directory

The 'types' directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It serves as a repository for TypeScript files that define various interfaces, types, and constants used throughout the project. These definitions provide a consistent structure for data and ensure type safety, which is a key aspect of TypeScript. The 'types' directory contributes to the overall modularity and maintainability of the codebase, as it allows developers to understand and use the defined structures across different parts of the application.

### Contents

The 'types' directory contains several TypeScript files, each defining different aspects of the project's data structures. There are no subdirectories within this directory. The files include:

- `data.ts`: Defines a key-value pair structure.
- `prompt.ts`: Outlines a prompt object.
- `plugin.ts`: Defines structures for plugins.
- `settings.ts`: Defines theme settings.
- `storage.ts`: Defines the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.
- `openai.ts`: Defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers.
- `chat.ts`: Defines structures for chat systems.
- `export.ts`: Relates to the application's export functionality.
- `google.ts`: Structures data related to Google's services.
- `folder.ts`: Defines a 'Folder' object.
- `index.ts`: An empty placeholder file.
- `error.ts`: Structures error messages.
- `env.ts`: Represents environment variables for the OpenAI API.

### Key Components

Several files in the 'types' directory play a critical role in the functioning of the chatbot-ui project:

- `data.ts`: This file defines the 'KeyValuePair' interface, which is likely used throughout the project wherever a key-value pair structure is needed.
- `prompt.ts`: This file defines the 'Prompt' interface, which provides a consistent structure for prompt objects throughout the codebase.
- `plugin.ts`: This file defines the structure and data for plugins in the application, including interfaces for a plugin and its key, enums for plugin identification and naming, and a record of all plugins.
- `storage.ts`: This file defines the local storage schema for a chatbot UI, including properties for an API key, conversation history, selected conversation, theme, folders, prompts, visibility of chat and prompt bars, and plugin keys.
- `openai.ts`: This file defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers, including an interface for an OpenAI model, an enum for model identifiers, a default model identifier, and a record mapping model identifiers to their respective model details.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the 'types' directory are used throughout the chatbot-ui project to provide a consistent structure for data and ensure type safety. For instance, the 'KeyValuePair' interface defined in `data.ts` is likely used wherever a key-value pair structure is needed. Similarly, the 'Prompt' interface defined in `prompt.ts` provides a consistent structure for prompt objects throughout the codebase.

The 'plugin.ts' file defines the structure and data for plugins in the application. It includes interfaces for a plugin and its key, enums for plugin identification and naming, and a record of all plugins. This structure is likely used when interacting with plugins in the application.

The 'storage.ts' file defines the local storage schema for a chatbot UI. This schema includes properties for an API key, conversation history, selected conversation, theme, folders, prompts, visibility of chat and prompt bars, and plugin keys. This structure is likely used when interacting with the local storage of the chatbot UI.

The 'openai.ts' file defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers. This structure includes an interface for an OpenAI model, an enum for model identifiers, a default model identifier, and a record mapping model identifiers to their respective model details. This structure is likely used when interacting with the OpenAI API in the application.
