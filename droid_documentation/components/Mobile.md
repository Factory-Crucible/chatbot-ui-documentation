## `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot application. It encapsulates the mobile-specific components, ensuring a clean separation of concerns between the desktop and mobile versions of the application. Currently, the directory contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component for the mobile application's navigation bar. This component is a critical part of the mobile user interface, as it allows users to navigate between different conversations in the chat application.

### Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory contains the following file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines a functional component named `Navbar` that is used in the navigation bar of the mobile chat application. The component accepts two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`. The `selectedConversation` prop is an object of type `Conversation` representing the currently active chat, while the `onNewConversation` prop is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an `IconPlus` button that, when clicked, triggers the `onNewConversation` function.

### Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is a key component in the `components/Mobile` directory. It defines the `Navbar` functional component, which is a critical part of the mobile user interface. The `Navbar` component is responsible for displaying the currently active conversation and providing an interface for users to start new conversations. This component plays a crucial role in the user experience of the mobile chat application, as it directly influences how users navigate between different conversations.

### Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot application. It is typically rendered at the top of the screen, providing a consistent navigation interface across different screens of the application.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
import { Navbar } from './components/Mobile/Navbar';

function MobileApp() {
  const [selectedConversation, setSelectedConversation] = useState<Conversation>(null);

  const handleNewConversation = () => {
    // Logic to start a new conversation
  };

  return (
    <Navbar
      selectedConversation={selectedConversation}
      onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, the `Navbar` component is rendered within the `MobileApp` component. The `selectedConversation` state and the `handleNewConversation` function are passed as props to the `Navbar` component. When the `IconPlus` button within the `Navbar` component is clicked, it triggers the `handleNewConversation` function, allowing users to start new conversations.
