## `components/Settings` Directory

The `components/Settings` directory is a crucial part of the `chatbot-ui` project, serving as the hub for managing various settings of the application. This directory contains three TypeScript React component files, namely `SettingDialog.tsx`, `Import.tsx`, and `Key.tsx`. These components are responsible for managing a settings dialog, providing an import functionality, and managing the API key settings respectively. Each of these components plays a significant role in enhancing the user experience by providing a seamless interface for managing application settings.

### Contents

The `components/Settings` directory is structured into three TypeScript files:

- `SettingDialog.tsx`: This file exports a functional component that manages a settings dialog. The dialog allows users to change the application theme and handles outside clicks to close the dialog.

- `Import.tsx`: This file provides an import functionality, rendering a file input and a button that triggers the file picker. It reads the selected file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls a function with the parsed data.

- `Key.tsx`: This file manages the API key settings, maintaining a local state for the key and a flag indicating if the key is being changed. It handles key press events, updates the key when 'Enter' is pressed, and focuses on the input field when the key is being changed. It renders either an input field for changing the key or a button to initiate the change, depending on the state.

### Key Components

The `components/Settings` directory houses three key components that play a vital role in the functionality of the `chatbot-ui` project:

- `SettingDialog`: This component is responsible for managing the settings dialog. It fetches the current settings using the `getSettings` utility function and allows the user to change the theme of the application. The new settings are saved using the `saveSettings` utility function. The component also handles outside clicks to close the dialog.

- `Import`: This component provides an import functionality for the application. It uses the `next-i18next` library for internationalization and the `@tabler/icons-react` library for icons. The component accepts a prop `onImport` which is a function that takes a parameter of type `SupportedExportFormats`. When a file is selected, it reads the file as text and parses it as JSON, then calls the `onImport` function with the parsed data.

- `Key`: This component manages the API key settings for the application. It maintains a local state for the API key and a boolean flag to indicate whether the key is being changed. The component handles key press events and updates the API key when the 'Enter' key is pressed. It also uses an effect to focus on the input field when the key is being changed.

### Usage & Examples

The components in the `components/Settings` directory are used to manage various settings of the `chatbot-ui` application. They are typically used in the settings section of the application, providing users with an interface to manage application settings.

For instance, the `SettingDialog` component is used to manage a settings dialog. It is typically used when a user wants to change the application theme. The component fetches the current settings, allows the user to change the theme, and saves the new settings.

The `Import` component is used to provide an import functionality for the application. It is typically used when a user wants to import data into the application. The component renders a file input and a button that triggers the file picker. When a file is selected, it reads the file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls a function with the parsed data.

The `Key` component is used to manage the API key settings for the application. It is typically used when a user wants to change the API key. The component maintains a local state for the API key and a flag indicating if the key is being changed. It handles key press events, updates the key when 'Enter' is pressed, and focuses on the input field when the key is being changed.
