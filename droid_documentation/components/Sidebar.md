### Usage & Examples

The files in the `components/Sidebar` directory are used to manage the sidebar in the chatbot UI. The Sidebar component, defined in `Sidebar.tsx`, is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization.

The `SidebarButton.tsx` file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. Here is an example of how it might be used:

```typescript
<SidebarButton text="Home" icon={<HomeIcon />} onClick={handleHomeClick} />
```

The `components/Sidebar/components/OpenCloseButton.tsx` file exports two components, 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton', which are responsible for opening and closing the sidebar. Here is an example of how they might be used:
