# `__tests__` Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the `chatbot-ui` project. It is structured to reflect the organization of the codebase, with subdirectories corresponding to the different parts of the application. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within `utils`, there's another subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- `utils`: This subdirectory serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. It contains a subdirectory named `app`, which houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.

### Key Components

The `__tests__` directory contains a key file:

- `importExports.test.ts`: This file tests the import and export operations of the application. It verifies that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version and that the `cleanData` function correctly updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

### Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house the tests for the `chatbot-ui` project. The tests are organized into subdirectories that mirror the structure of the codebase, allowing for easy navigation and understanding of what each test covers.

For example, the `importExports.test.ts` file in the `app` subdirectory of `utils` tests the import and export operations of the application. It contains several `describe` and `it` blocks that outline the different scenarios being tested. Here's a simplified example of what the structure of these tests might look like:

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {
    it('should return true for v1 format', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
    it('should return false for non-v1 formats', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
  });
  // Other export format tests...
  describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
    describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {
      it('should return the latest format', () => {
        // Test code here
      });
    });
    // Other cleanData tests...
  });
});
```

This structure allows for clear and organized tests that are easy to understand and maintain.
