# Public Directory

The `public` directory serves as a repository for static files that are not processed by the build pipeline. These files are directly accessible by the client-side and are typically used for assets like images, favicons, and other static resources that need to be served directly by the server. The `public` directory contains a mix of files and a subdirectory, each serving a specific purpose in the project.

## Contents

The `public` directory contains the following files and subdirectory:

- `favicon.ico`: This file is typically used by browsers for displaying a small icon in the browser's tab. It's a standard part of web development and is included in the `public` directory because it needs to be served directly by the server.
- `screenshot.png`: This file is an image file, likely used somewhere in the project for display purposes. As a static file, it is placed in the `public` directory to be served directly by the server.
- `.DS_Store`: This is a system file automatically created by macOS. It's not directly related to the project and is typically ignored in the .gitignore file.
- `screenshots`: This is a subdirectory within the `public` directory. It's dedicated to storing screenshot files, which are likely used somewhere in the project for display purposes.

### Screenshots Subdirectory

The `screenshots` subdirectory within the `public` directory is dedicated to storing screenshot files. It currently contains a single file:

- `screenshot-0402023.jpg`: This file is an image file, likely a screenshot used somewhere in the project for display purposes. As a static file, it is placed in the `screenshots` subdirectory to be served directly by the server.

## Key Components

The key components of the `public` directory are the static files it contains. These files, such as `favicon.ico` and `screenshot.png`, are important because they are served directly by the server and are accessible by the client-side. They are typically used for assets like images and favicons that need to be served directly by the server.

The `screenshots` subdirectory is also a key component of the `public` directory. It organizes screenshot files into a dedicated location, making it easier to manage these files.

## Usage & Examples

The files in the `public` directory are used whenever a static file needs to be served directly by the server. For example, the `favicon.ico` file is used by browsers to display a small icon in the browser's tab. The `screenshot.png` and `screenshot-0402023.jpg` files are likely used somewhere in the project for display purposes.

The exact usage of these files depends on the specific needs of the project. However, they are typically referenced in the project's code using a path that starts from the `public` directory. For example, a file located at `public/screenshots/screenshot-0402023.jpg` would be referenced in the code as `/screenshots/screenshot-0402023.jpg`.
