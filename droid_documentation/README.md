Welcome to the documentation for the `Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation` repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. The documentation is generated and maintained by the Documentation Droid, ensuring it remains up-to-date as the codebase evolves.

## Overview

### Purpose

The `Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation` repository is dedicated to the development of a chatbot user interface (UI). This repository is a part of a larger ecosystem, interacting with other services to provide a comprehensive chatbot solution.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on technologies such as Docker, Node.js, TypeScript, React, and Kubernetes. It also utilizes various tools like Makefile, Prettier, PostCSS, and Tailwind CSS.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components, including a frontend library, a backend library, and a CLI. The frontend library is primarily built with React and TypeScript, while the backend library handles server-side operations. The CLI provides a command-line interface for interacting with the application.

### Conventions

The codebase follows certain conventions, such as file naming conventions and directory structures. Understanding these conventions is crucial for navigating the codebase effectively.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into various directories, each serving a specific purpose. Some directories contain a significant amount of code, while others house static assets and are rarely utilized. The structure of the codebase is outlined using the `tree` visual, providing a hierarchical view of the directories and files.

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The codebase consists of several main flows, some of which are specific to certain user stories, while others recur frequently throughout the repository. Understanding these flows is crucial for comprehending how data moves from one end of the system to the other. For a more in-depth understanding of these flows, refer to the respective documentation files linked within the text.

### System Connections

The codebase interacts with both internal and external systems. Understanding these connections is essential for comprehending the dependencies and interactions between different areas of the code. The codebase contains services or components that interact with each other, providing a high-level description of their placement and interactions.

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows certain testing principles, utilizing a dedicated `__tests__` directory for housing test suites. The main types of tests and their basic principles are outlined in the respective documentation files.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation for this codebase is structured into various markdown files, each providing detailed information about a specific aspect of the codebase. The documentation files are organized into directories that mirror the structure of the codebase, making it easy to find the relevant documentation for any part of the codebase.
