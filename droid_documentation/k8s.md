# `k8s` Directory Documentation

The `k8s` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses the Kubernetes configurations that are essential for the deployment and management of the chatbot UI application in a Kubernetes environment. Kubernetes, a powerful container orchestration tool, is used to manage the application across a cluster of servers, ensuring scalability and reliability. The configurations in this directory are defined in a single file, `chatbot-ui.yaml`, which outlines the necessary Kubernetes resources for the application.

## Contents

The `k8s` directory is straightforward and contains a single file:

- `chatbot-ui.yaml`: This is a Kubernetes configuration file that defines the necessary resources for deploying and managing the chatbot UI application in a Kubernetes environment.

## Key Components

The `chatbot-ui.yaml` file is the key component of this directory. It outlines four Kubernetes resources that are crucial for the deployment and management of the chatbot UI application:

- **Namespace**: The Namespace, named 'chatbot-ui', is used to isolate the resources of the chatbot UI application. This isolation is beneficial for managing resources in a large cluster and for separating different parts of the application.

- **Secret**: The Secret resource is used to store the OpenAI API key in a secure, base64 encoded format. This key is necessary for the chatbot functionality of the application.

- **Deployment**: The Deployment resource specifies the Docker image to be used, the number of replicas, and the container port. It also retrieves the OpenAI API key from the Secret. This resource is responsible for the actual deployment of the application in the Kubernetes environment.

- **Service**: The Service resource exposes the Deployment on port 80 and routes traffic to the container port 3000. This resource is crucial for making the application accessible to users.

## Usage & Examples

The `k8s` directory is used during the deployment process of the chatbot UI application. When deploying the application in a Kubernetes environment, the `chatbot-ui.yaml` file is applied to create the necessary Kubernetes resources.

For example, to deploy the application, one might use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
kubectl apply -f chatbot-ui.yaml
```

This command tells Kubernetes to create the resources defined in the `chatbot-ui.yaml` file. Once the resources are created, the application is deployed and managed by Kubernetes according to the specifications in the file.

Please note that this is a simplified example and actual usage may vary depending on the specific deployment environment and requirements.
