## components/Buttons

The `components/Buttons` directory is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project. This specific directory, `components/Buttons`, is dedicated to defining and managing the button components used throughout the user interface of the chatbot. It contains a subdirectory named `SidebarActionButton` which defines a specific type of button used in the sidebar of the chatbot UI.

### Contents

The `components/Buttons` directory contains one subdirectory:

- `SidebarActionButton`: This subdirectory houses the definition and export of the `SidebarActionButton` component. It contains two files: `index.ts` and `SidebarActionButton.tsx`.

### Key Components

- `SidebarActionButton`: This is a React component defined in the `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file. It represents a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`. The `handleClick` prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the `children` prop renders any child elements within the button.

### Usage & Examples

The `SidebarActionButton` component is used throughout the codebase wherever a button with its specific styling and functionality is needed, particularly in the sidebar of the chatbot UI. The `handleClick` prop is used to pass a function that will be executed when the button is clicked, and the `children` prop is used to render any child elements within the button.

```typescript
<SidebarActionButton handleClick={this.handleButtonClick}>
  <Icon />
</SidebarActionButton>
```

In the above example, an `Icon` component is passed as a child to the `SidebarActionButton`, and `this.handleButtonClick` is passed as the `handleClick` prop to handle the button's click event.
