## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. This feature is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. The directory contains TypeScript files and a subdirectory, each playing a unique role in the overall functionality of the 'Promptbar' component.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory named `components`. The TypeScript files include `index.ts`, `PromptBar.context.tsx`, `Promptbar.tsx`, and `Promptbar.state.tsx`. The `index.ts` file serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the default export from the `Promptbar.tsx` file. The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. The `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file, representing the sidebar in the user interface, with functions for managing prompts and folders. The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory contains related components. These include `Prompts.tsx` which renders a list of prompts, `PromptbarSettings.tsx` which is for 'Promptbar' settings, `Prompt.tsx` which manages prompts, `PromptModal.tsx` which renders a modal for editing prompts, and `PromptFolders.tsx` which manages folders within the 'Promptbar'.

### Key Components

The `Promptbar.tsx` file is a key component in this directory. It represents the 'Promptbar' component, a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. This file uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects, and imports several other components such as 'PromptFolders', 'PromptbarSettings', and 'Prompts'. It also imports a context 'HomeContext' and a state 'Promptbar.state'.

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is another critical component. It defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. This context is then exported for use in other parts of the application, allowing for state management and the handling of prompts across multiple components.

The `components/Promptbar/components/Prompt.tsx` file is a significant component within the subdirectory. This component handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and manages local state for various functionalities. It also handles drag events for the prompt and uses effects to manage the renaming and deleting states.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to manage the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. The 'Promptbar' is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders.

For instance, the `Promptbar.tsx` file is used to represent the 'Promptbar' component. It uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects, and imports several other components such as 'PromptFolders', 'PromptbarSettings', and 'Prompts'. It also imports a context 'HomeContext' and a state 'Promptbar.state'.

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is used to define the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. This context is then used in other parts of the application to manage state and handle prompts.

The `components/Promptbar/components/Prompt.tsx` file is used to handle actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and manage local state for various functionalities. It also handles drag events for the prompt and uses effects to manage the renaming and deleting states.

The `components/Promptbar/components/PromptFolders.tsx` file is used to handle the display and functionality of folders within the 'Promptbar', including the dropping of prompts into folders. It updates the prompt's folderId when dropped, allowing for the organization of prompts within folders.
