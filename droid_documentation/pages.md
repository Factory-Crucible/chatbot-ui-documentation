# `pages` Directory

The `pages` directory is a fundamental part of the `chatbot-ui` project, serving as the home for key files and subdirectories that define the structure and behavior of the application's pages. This directory is a standard feature in Next.js applications, where each file corresponds to a route in the application. The `pages` directory in this project contains the main entry point for the home page (`index.tsx`), a custom Document (`_document.tsx`), and a custom App component (`_app.tsx`). It also includes an `api` subdirectory that houses files for handling API requests and responses, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

## Contents

The `pages` directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

- `index.tsx`: This file serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application, defining an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.

- `api`: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

## Key Components

The `pages` directory contains several key components that are critical to the functioning of the application:

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from a sibling file in the 'api' subdirectory named 'home'.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries.

- `api`: This subdirectory is responsible for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and managing the 'home' page of the application.

## Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used to define the structure and behavior of the application's pages. For instance, the `index.tsx` file serves as the main entry point for the home page of the application, exporting a React component and a server-side rendering function. The `_document.tsx` file is a custom Document for the Next.js application, defining an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts. The `_app.tsx` file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries.

The `api` subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and managing the 'home' page of the application. For example, the `models.ts` file handles requests related to OpenAI models, constructing URLs and fetching data from the OpenAI API. The `chat.ts` file serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality, processing requests, encoding messages, and interacting with an OpenAI service. The `google.ts` file handles API requests and responses, interacting with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API to generate prompts and send responses.

The `home` subdirectory within the `api` directory contains files related to the 'home' page of the application. The `home.tsx` file is a React component that serves as the main page, managing state and handling API calls. The `home.context.tsx` file defines the context for the 'home' page, outlining the 'HomeContextProps' interface and creating the 'HomeContext'. The `home.state.tsx` file defines the initial state for the 'Home' page, declaring the 'HomeInitialState' interface and exporting the 'initialState' constant.
