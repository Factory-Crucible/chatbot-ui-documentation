# `components/Buttons` Directory

The `components/Buttons` directory is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project, including the Sidebar, Settings, Buttons, Chatbar, Chat, Markdown, Folder, Spinner, Promptbar, Search, and Mobile components. Each of these components is responsible for a specific part of the user interface and functionality of the chatbot. The `components/Buttons` directory specifically contains a subdirectory named `SidebarActionButton`, which defines a React component named 'SidebarActionButton', a button with specific styling and two props: 'handleClick' and 'children'.

## Contents

The `components/Buttons` directory contains one subdirectory:

- `SidebarActionButton`: This subdirectory houses two files: 'index.ts' and 'SidebarActionButton.tsx'. 'index.ts' is a module export file that simplifies import paths by re-exporting the default export from 'SidebarActionButton.tsx'. The latter file defines a React component named 'SidebarActionButton', a button with specific styling and two props: 'handleClick' and 'children'.

## Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `SidebarActionButton` React component, defined in the `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file. This component is a button with specific styling and two props: 'handleClick' and 'children'. The 'handleClick' prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the 'children' prop renders any child elements within the button. The button's style includes a minimum width of 20px, padding of 1, and different text colors for normal and hover states.

## Usage & Examples

The `SidebarActionButton` component is used throughout the codebase wherever a button with specific styling is required. The 'handleClick' prop allows for custom functionality to be executed when the button is clicked, and the 'children' prop allows for any child elements to be rendered within the button.

For example, a `SidebarActionButton` might be used to toggle the visibility of a sidebar when clicked. The 'handleClick' prop would be passed a function that toggles a piece of state representing the visibility of the sidebar, and the 'children' prop might be passed a `<span>` element containing the text "Toggle Sidebar".
