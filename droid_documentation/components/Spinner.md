## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The Spinner component is a crucial part of the user experience, providing users with feedback that the application is processing their request or loading data.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. It accepts two optional props, 'size' and 'className', which control the dimensions of the spinner and allow for additional CSS classes, respectively. The spinner is created using SVG and includes an animation for the spinning effect.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component, exporting the default export from `Spinner.tsx`. This setup simplifies imports elsewhere in the project, as the Spinner component can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` without specifying the `Spinner.tsx` file.

The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the Spinner component, defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file. This component is a critical part of the user interface, providing a visual indication of loading states. The Spinner component is versatile, with its size and additional CSS classes customizable through props. This flexibility allows the Spinner component to be used in various parts of the application, adapting to different contexts and styles.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate loading states. Whenever the application is fetching data or processing a user request, the Spinner component can be rendered to provide visual feedback to the user.

While the `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE` does not provide a representative usage example, a typical usage of the Spinner component might look like this:

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

// ...

return (
  <div>
    {isLoading ? <Spinner size="2em" className="text-blue-500" /> : <DataDisplay data={data} />}
  </div>
);
```

In this example, the Spinner component is conditionally rendered based on the `isLoading` state. If `isLoading` is true, the Spinner is displayed with a size of '2em' and a blue color. If `isLoading` is false, the `DataDisplay` component is rendered instead to display the fetched data.
