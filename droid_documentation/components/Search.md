## `components/Search` Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the home for the `Search` component. This component is a functional React component written in TypeScript, designed to provide a search input field for the user interface. The `Search` component is a key part of the user interface, allowing users to search through the chatbot's content. It accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' represents the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input when clicked.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two main files: `Search.tsx` and `index.ts`. 

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that exports a functional component named 'Search'. It defines the structure and behavior of the `Search` component.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the `Search` directory, exporting the default from `Search.tsx`.

### Key Components

The `Search.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the `Search` component, which is a functional React component that provides a search input field for the user interface. This component is crucial for the functionality of the chatbot, allowing users to search through the chatbot's content.

### Usage & Examples

The `Search` component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project wherever a search input field is required. It is a reusable component that can be imported from the `components/Search` directory.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Search` component might be used:

```typescript
import Search from '../components/Search';

function SomeComponent() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

  return (
    <Search
      placeholder="Search..."
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      onSearch={setSearchTerm}
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, the `Search` component is imported from the `components/Search` directory. It is then used in `SomeComponent`, with the `placeholder` prop set to "Search...", the `searchTerm` prop bound to the `searchTerm` state variable, and the `onSearch` prop bound to the `setSearchTerm` function. This allows the `Search` component to display the current search term and update it when the user types in the search input field.
