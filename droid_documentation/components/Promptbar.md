## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. The 'Promptbar' is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. The directory contains TypeScript files that define the structure, state, and context of the 'Promptbar' component. It also includes a subdirectory named 'components' that houses related components such as 'Prompts', 'PromptbarSettings', 'Prompt', 'PromptModal', and 'PromptFolders'. These components work together to provide a comprehensive and interactive 'Promptbar' feature in the application.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: Serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the default export from the 'Promptbar.tsx' file.
- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: Defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: Represents a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: Defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.
- `components`: A subdirectory that contains related components such as 'Prompts', 'PromptbarSettings', 'Prompt', 'PromptModal', and 'PromptFolders'.

### Key Components

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several key components that contribute to the functionality of the 'Promptbar' feature:

- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file that represents the 'Promptbar' sidebar in the UI. It uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects, and imports several other components such as 'PromptFolders', 'PromptbarSettings', and 'Prompts'.
- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This context file outlines the shape of the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This state file outlines the structure of the initial state for the 'Promptbar' component, including a 'searchTerm' of type string and 'filteredPrompts' which is an array of 'Prompt' objects.
- `components/Prompt.tsx`: This component handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and manages local state for various functionalities.
- `components/PromptModal.tsx`: This component renders a modal for editing a prompt, with internationalization support.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to provide a comprehensive 'Promptbar' feature in the application. The 'Promptbar' component, defined in `Promptbar.tsx`, is a sidebar in the UI that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. It uses the context defined in `PromptBar.context.tsx` and the initial state defined in `Promptbar.state.tsx` to manage its state and effects.

The 'Promptbar' component imports several other components from the `components` subdirectory. For example, the 'Prompts' component, defined in `components/Prompts.tsx`, is used to display a list of prompts in the user interface. The 'Prompt' component, defined in `components/Prompt.tsx`, handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts. The 'PromptModal' component, defined in `components/PromptModal.tsx`, renders a modal for editing a prompt.

The 'Promptbar' component is exported from the `index.ts` file, allowing it to be imported directly from the 'Promptbar' directory in other parts of the application.
