## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a crucial part of the user interface, providing a visual cue to the user when the application is in a loading state. The Spinner component is a React component that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate that the application is processing data or waiting for a response from an API request. The directory contains two files: `Spinner.tsx` and `index.ts`.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. The component accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop controls the dimensions of the spinner, while the 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner. The spinner is created using SVG and includes an animation for the spinning effect.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component, exporting the default export from `Spinner.tsx`. This setup simplifies imports elsewhere in the project, as the Spinner component can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` without specifying the `Spinner.tsx` file.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the Spinner component, defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file. This component is a critical part of the user interface, providing a visual indication of a loading state. The Spinner component is designed to be flexible and reusable, accepting optional props for size and additional CSS classes. This allows the component to be used in various parts of the application, with different sizes and styles as needed.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate a loading state. For example, it may be displayed while the application is waiting for a response from an API request, or while data is being processed.

The Spinner component can be imported into other parts of the project using the following import statement:

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';
```

Once imported, the Spinner component can be used in a React component like so:

```typescript
<Spinner size="2em" className="custom-spinner" />
```

In this example, the Spinner component is given a size of '2em' and a custom CSS class of 'custom-spinner'. This demonstrates the flexibility and reusability of the Spinner component, as it can be customized to fit the needs of different parts of the application.
