# `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The Spinner component is a crucial part of the user experience, providing visual feedback during operations that require some time to complete, such as API calls or data processing tasks. The directory contains two TypeScript files that define and export the Spinner component.

## Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains the following files:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component, exporting the default export from `Spinner.tsx`. This setup simplifies imports elsewhere in the project, as the Spinner component can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` without specifying the `Spinner.tsx` file.

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component, which displays a spinning animation typically used to indicate a loading state. It accepts 'size' and 'className' as optional props, with 'size' controlling the spinner's dimensions and 'className' allowing for additional CSS classes. The spinner is created using SVG and includes an animation for the spinning effect.

The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

## Key Components

The key component in this directory is the Spinner component, defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file. This component is a crucial part of the user interface, providing visual feedback during operations that require some time to complete. The Spinner component accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop determines the height and width of the spinner, defaulting to '1em' if not provided. The 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner, defaulting to an empty string if not provided. The spinner is created using SVG and has an animation applied to it to create the spinning effect.

## Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project whenever there is a need to indicate a loading state. This could be during an API call, data processing, or any other operation that requires some time to complete. The component can be customized using the 'size' and 'className' props, allowing for flexibility in its appearance and behavior.

For example, a Spinner component could be used in a component that fetches data from an API. While the data is being fetched, the Spinner component could be displayed to indicate to the user that the operation is in progress. Once the data has been fetched, the Spinner component could be replaced with the fetched data.

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

const FetchDataComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData().then((fetchedData) => {
      setData(fetchedData);
      setLoading(false);
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {loading ? <Spinner size="2em" className="my-spinner" /> : <DisplayData data={data} />}
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the Spinner component is imported from 'components/Spinner'. It is then used in the 'FetchDataComponent' component. While the data is being fetched, the 'loading' state is true, and the Spinner component is displayed with a size of '2em' and a CSS class of 'my-spinner'. Once the data has been fetched, the 'loading' state is set to false, and the Spinner component is replaced with the 'DisplayData' component, which displays the fetched data.
