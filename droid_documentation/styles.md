## Styles Directory

The `styles` directory in the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository plays a crucial role in defining the visual aesthetics of the chatbot user interface. It houses the global styles that are applied across the entire project, ensuring a consistent look and feel. The directory contains a single file, `globals.css`, which is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file that holds the global styles for the project. This file is responsible for importing base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework, a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs. It also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar and sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade. 

### Contents

The `styles` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing only one file:

- `globals.css`: This file is the heart of the `styles` directory. It contains the global styles that are applied throughout the project. It imports base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework, and includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. The file also sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade. It contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Additionally, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Key Components

The `globals.css` file is the key component of the `styles` directory. It is responsible for defining the global styles that are applied across the entire project. This includes the import of base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework, custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, and the setting of the HTML document's background color to a dark shade. The file also contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Lastly, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'. This file is crucial in ensuring a consistent look and feel across the entire project.

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file is used to define the global styles that are applied across the entire project. It is included in the project's build process, and its styles are applied to every page of the application. The file is written in CSS, a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.

For example, the file includes a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px. This media query adjusts the width of 'pre' elements under this condition, ensuring that the layout of the application is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. This is a typical usage pattern for media queries in CSS.

Another example is the custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. These styles are applied to the track, thumb, and corner of the scrollbar, with different styles for hover states. This ensures that the scrollbar has a consistent look and feel across the entire application, and enhances the user experience by providing a custom scrollbar that matches the overall design of the application.
