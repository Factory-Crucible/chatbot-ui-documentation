# `utils` Directory

The `utils` directory is a crucial part of the `chatbot-ui` project, serving as a hub for utility files and subdirectories that manage various aspects of the project. These utilities range from managing chat conversations, saving folders to local storage, mapping programming languages to file extensions, to handling the import and export of chatbot data. The directory is divided into three subdirectories: `app`, `server`, and `data`, each focusing on a specific area of the project.

## Contents

The `utils` directory contains three subdirectories and a `.DS_Store` file. The subdirectories are:

- `app`: This directory contains utility files for the chatbot UI project, managing everything from saving folders to local storage, mapping programming languages to file extensions, managing chat conversations, and handling the import and export of chatbot data.

- `server`: This directory provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and a function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API. It also contains a function that standardizes text data.

- `data`: This directory contains a 'throttle' function that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed.

## Key Components

The `utils` directory houses several key components that are integral to the functioning of the `chatbot-ui` project. Some of these include:

- `const.ts`: This file defines several constants used throughout the application, primarily related to the configuration of the OpenAI API and some default settings for the chatbot.

- `folders.ts`: This file manages saving folders to local storage.

- `codeblock.ts`: This file maps programming languages to their respective file extensions and generates random strings.

- `settings.ts`: This file manages application settings and interacts with local storage.

- `api.ts`: This file determines the appropriate API endpoint based on the provided plugin.

- `prompts.ts`: This file provides functions for managing 'Prompt' objects.

- `importExport.ts`: This file handles the import and export of chatbot data.

- `conversation.ts`: This file provides functions for managing chat conversations.

- `clean.ts`: This file ensures the presence of certain properties in conversation objects and cleans conversation history.

- `index.ts`: This file provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and an 'OpenAIStream' function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API.

- `google.ts`: This file contains a 'cleanSourceText' function that standardizes text data by performing various transformations.

- `throttle.ts`: This file defines a generic function 'throttle' that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed.

## Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `utils` directory are used throughout the `chatbot-ui` project to perform various utility functions. For instance, the `const.ts` file in the `app` subdirectory defines several constants that are used throughout the application, such as `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `OPENAI_API_HOST`, `DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE`, `OPENAI_API_TYPE`, `OPENAI_API_VERSION`, `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION`, and `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_ID`.

The `folders.ts` file in the same subdirectory contains a function `saveFolders` that is used to save an array of folders to the local storage. The `codeblock.ts` file maps programming languages to their respective file extensions and generates random strings, which is likely used to handle code blocks in various programming languages and generate unique identifiers within the application.

The `settings.ts` file manages application settings by retrieving and storing them in the local storage. The `api.ts` file determines the appropriate API endpoint based on the provided plugin, which is used when making API requests.

The `prompts.ts` file provides functions for managing 'Prompt' objects, including updating and saving prompts. The `importExport.ts` file handles the import and export of chatbot data, including checking the version of the export format, cleaning the data, and exporting and importing data.

The `conversation.ts` file provides functions for managing chat conversations, including updating and saving conversations. The `clean.ts` file ensures the presence of certain properties in conversation objects and cleans conversation history.

In the `server` subdirectory, the `index.ts` file provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and an 'OpenAIStream' function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API. The `google.ts` file contains a 'cleanSourceText' function that standardizes text data by performing various transformations.

In the `data` subdirectory, the `throttle.ts` file defines a generic function 'throttle' that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed. This is likely used to limit the rate at which certain functions can be called, such as API requests or other resource-intensive operations.
