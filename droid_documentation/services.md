## Services Directory

The `services` directory plays a crucial role in the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses two TypeScript files that define custom React hooks, `useErrorService` and `useApiService`. These hooks are integral to the application's error handling and API interaction mechanisms. The `useErrorService` hook provides localized error messages, while the `useApiService` hook facilitates API calls to the '/api/models' endpoint. The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Contents

The `services` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named `useErrorService`. The hook leverages the `useTranslation` hook from 'next-i18next' to provide localized error messages. It returns a function `getModelsError` that takes an error object and returns an 'ErrorMessage' object with a title, status code, and list of messages. The title and messages are translated using the `useTranslation` hook.
- `useApiService.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useApiService`. This hook uses another custom hook `useFetch` to make API calls. The hook provides a function `getModels` which makes a POST request to the '/api/models' endpoint. The function accepts an object of type 'GetModelsRequestProps' and an optional 'AbortSignal' as parameters.

### Key Components

The `services` directory contains two key TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: The `useErrorService` hook defined in this file is a critical component of the application's error handling mechanism. It provides a function `getModelsError` that takes an error object and returns an 'ErrorMessage' object. This function is used throughout the application to provide localized error messages.
- `useApiService.ts`: The `useApiService` hook defined in this file is a key component of the application's API interaction mechanism. It provides a function `getModels` that makes a POST request to the '/api/models' endpoint. This function is used throughout the application to fetch models from the API.

### Usage & Examples

The `services` directory is used to house custom React hooks that are used throughout the application. The hooks defined in this directory, `useErrorService` and `useApiService`, are used in various components and modules of the application.

For instance, the `useErrorService` hook is used in components that need to display error messages. The hook is invoked, and the returned `getModelsError` function is used to generate an 'ErrorMessage' object from an error object. This 'ErrorMessage' object is then used to display a localized error message to the user.

Similarly, the `useApiService` hook is used in components that need to make API calls to the '/api/models' endpoint. The hook is invoked, and the returned `getModels` function is used to make a POST request to the '/api/models' endpoint. The function accepts an object of type 'GetModelsRequestProps' and an optional 'AbortSignal' as parameters, and returns the result of the fetch operation.
