## Hooks Directory

The `hooks` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to housing custom React hooks. These hooks, defined in TypeScript, provide reusable logic that can be utilized across various components in the project. The directory contains two key files: `useCreateReducer.ts` and `useFetch.ts`. Each of these files exports a custom hook that encapsulates specific functionality, allowing for cleaner and more maintainable code.

### Contents

The `hooks` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file defines a custom hook named `useCreateReducer` that is designed to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. It also defines two TypeScript types: `FieldNames` and `ActionType` which are used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.
- `useFetch.ts`: This file exports a custom hook named `useFetch` that is used for making HTTP requests. It defines two types, `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel`, to structure the request parameters. The hook provides methods for each HTTP verb (get, post, put, patch, delete).

### Key Components

The `hooks` directory contains two critical files:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: The `useCreateReducer` hook is a key component in state management within the application. By providing a typed reducer with dispatch and state, it ensures type safety and reduces the likelihood of bugs related to incorrect types. The `FieldNames` and `ActionType` types further enhance the robustness of the reducer by providing a structure for the initial state and dispatch action.
- `useFetch.ts`: The `useFetch` hook is a crucial part of the application's interaction with external APIs. It provides a structured and reusable way to make HTTP requests, encapsulating the logic for constructing the request and handling the response, including error handling. This makes the process of interacting with APIs more efficient and less error-prone.

### Usage & Examples

The hooks defined in the `hooks` directory are used throughout the codebase to provide reusable logic and maintain clean, DRY code.

- `useCreateReducer`: This hook is used when there is a need to manage complex state in a component. It provides a reducer with typed dispatch and state, ensuring type safety. Here's a simplified example of how it might be used:

```typescript
const { state, dispatch } = useCreateReducer({
  initialState: { count: 0 }
});

dispatch({ type: 'increment', payload: 1 });
```

- `useFetch`: This hook is used to make HTTP requests to external APIs. It provides methods for each HTTP verb, making it easy to perform any type of request. Here's a simplified example of how it might be used:

```typescript
const { get } = useFetch();

const response = await get('/api/data');
```

Please note that these examples are simplified and may not represent the exact usage in the codebase. Always refer to the actual code for the most accurate information.
