## components/Chatbar

The `components/Chatbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It houses the logic and structure for the chat bar, a key component of the user interface. The chat bar is responsible for managing conversations, handling API keys, and providing settings for the chatbot. The directory contains three TypeScript files, each serving a specific purpose in the chat bar's functionality. It also includes a subdirectory, `components/Chatbar/components`, which contains additional components used in the chat bar.

### Contents

The `components/Chatbar` directory contains three TypeScript files:

- `Chatbar.state.tsx`: This file sets the initial state for the Chatbar component, including a search term and a list of filtered conversations.
- `Chatbar.tsx`: This is a React component representing the chat bar, with handlers for various actions like changing API keys and managing conversations.
- `Chatbar.context.tsx`: This file defines the context for the Chatbar component, including the state, dispatch function, and several handler functions.

The directory also includes a subdirectory, `components/Chatbar/components`, which contains six TypeScript files, each exporting a React component used in the chatbot UI. These components handle settings, conversations, chat folders, and plugin keys.

### Key Components

The `Chatbar.tsx` file is a key component in this directory. It is a React component that represents the chat bar of the chatbot application. This component is responsible for managing the state of the chat bar, handling user interactions, and rendering the chat bar on the screen. It uses several hooks for state and context management and defines several handlers for different actions such as changing API keys, handling plugin keys, exporting and importing data, clearing conversations, deleting conversations, and toggling the chat bar.

The `Chatbar.context.tsx` file is another critical component. It defines the context for the Chatbar component, providing a way to share state and handler functions between the Chatbar component and its children. This context includes the state, dispatch function, and several handler functions for managing conversations, exporting and importing data, and handling changes to plugin keys and API keys.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `components/Chatbar` directory are used to manage the chat bar in the chatbot UI. The `Chatbar.tsx` file exports a `Chatbar` component that can be used in other parts of the application. This component takes no props and manages its own state and handlers, making it easy to use.

The `Chatbar.context.tsx` file exports a `ChatbarContext` that can be used by other components to access the state and handlers of the Chatbar component. This context can be used with the `useContext` hook in functional components or the `contextType` property in class components.

The `components/Chatbar/components` subdirectory contains several components that can be used in the chat bar. For example, the `ClearConversations.tsx` component can be used to add a button to the chat bar that clears all conversations when clicked. This component takes a `onClearConversations` prop, which is a function that is called when the button is clicked.

```typescript
import { ClearConversations } from 'components/Chatbar/components/ClearConversations';

function MyComponent() {
  const handleClearConversations = () => {
    // Clear conversations logic here...
  };

  return (
    <ClearConversations onClearConversations={handleClearConversations} />
  );
}
```

Similarly, the `PluginKeys.tsx` component can be used to add a settings interface to the chat bar for managing plugin keys. This component takes no props and manages its own state and handlers.

```typescript
import { PluginKeys } from 'components/Chatbar/components/PluginKeys';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <PluginKeys />
  );
}
```
