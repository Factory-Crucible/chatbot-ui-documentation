## Services Directory

The `services` directory is a critical part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses two TypeScript files, `errorService.ts` and `useApiService.ts`, which define custom React hooks that are integral to the functionality of the chatbot UI. These hooks provide localized error messages and make API calls respectively, contributing to the overall user experience and functionality of the chatbot.

### Contents

The `services` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named `useErrorService` that provides localized error messages using the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next`. The hook returns a function `getModelsError` that takes an error object and returns an `ErrorMessage` object with a title, status code, and list of messages.
- `useApiService.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useApiService` that uses another custom hook `useFetch` to make API calls. The hook provides a function `getModels` which makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint.

### Key Components

The `services` directory contains two key TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: The `useErrorService` hook defined in this file is crucial for providing localized error messages to the user. This enhances the user experience by providing clear and understandable error messages. The `getModelsError` function, which is returned by the `useErrorService` hook, takes an error object and returns an `ErrorMessage` object. This object contains a title, a status code, and a list of messages, providing comprehensive information about the error.
- `useApiService.ts`: The `useApiService` hook defined in this file is responsible for making API calls using the `useFetch` hook. The `getModels` function, which is provided by the `useApiService` hook, makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint. This function is essential for fetching data from the API, contributing to the functionality of the chatbot.

### Usage & Examples

The `useErrorService` hook in `errorService.ts` is used to provide localized error messages. It is used in components that need to display error messages to the user. The `getModelsError` function returned by the hook takes an error object and returns an `ErrorMessage` object. This object is then used to display the error message to the user.

The `useApiService` hook in `useApiService.ts` is used to make API calls. It is used in components that need to fetch data from the API. The `getModels` function returned by the hook makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint. The function takes an object of type `GetModelsRequestProps` and an optional `AbortSignal` as parameters. The result of the fetch operation is then used in the component.
