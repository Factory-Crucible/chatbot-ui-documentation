# `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project, each responsible for a specific part of the user interface and functionality of the chatbot. The `components/Mobile` directory specifically contains files related to the mobile version of the application, focusing on the navigation bar functionality for the chat application in a mobile context.

## Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is a simple, single-purpose directory with no subdirectories. It contains one TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component named 'Navbar' for the mobile application.

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines a functional component named 'Navbar' specifically designed for the mobile application's navigation bar. The 'Navbar' component is used in a chat application and accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The 'selectedConversation' prop is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat. The 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

## Key Components

The `components/Mobile` directory contains a single key component, the `Navbar` component, defined in the `Navbar.tsx` file. This component is critical to the mobile user interface of the chatbot, as it provides the navigation bar functionality.

- `Navbar` Component: This functional component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of a chat application. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation', which is an object of type 'Conversation', and 'onNewConversation', which is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button that, when clicked, triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

## Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component defined in the `components/Mobile` directory is used within the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is responsible for displaying the navigation bar in the mobile context, showing the currently active conversation and providing a way to initiate a new conversation.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. When the 'IconPlus' button in the `Navbar` component is clicked, it triggers the `handleNewConversation` function, initiating a new conversation.
