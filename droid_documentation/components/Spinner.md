# `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a crucial part of the user interface, providing a visual indication of loading states within the application. The Spinner component is a React component defined in TypeScript, and it is designed to display a spinning animation. This directory contains two files: `Spinner.tsx`, which defines the Spinner component, and `index.ts`, which serves as an entry point for the Spinner component.

## Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. The component is designed to display a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. It accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop controls the dimensions of the spinner, while the 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component, exporting the default export from `Spinner.tsx`. This setup simplifies imports elsewhere in the project, as the Spinner component can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` without specifying the `Spinner.tsx` file.

## Key Components

The key component in this directory is the Spinner component, defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file. This component is crucial for indicating loading states within the application. It is designed to display a spinning animation, created using SVG, and accepts two optional props for customization: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop controls the dimensions of the spinner, while the 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner.

## Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate loading states. Whenever an operation is in progress and the application is waiting for a response, the Spinner component is rendered to provide a visual indication to the user.

While specific usage patterns depend on the context within the application, a typical usage of the Spinner component might look like this:

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

function ExampleComponent() {
  const isLoading = true; // This would typically be dynamic
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? <Spinner size="2em" className="text-blue-500" /> : 'Content'}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the Spinner component is imported from the `components/Spinner` directory. It is then conditionally rendered based on the `isLoading` state. If `isLoading` is true, the Spinner component is rendered with a size of '2em' and a CSS class of 'text-blue-500'. If `isLoading` is false, the string 'Content' is rendered instead.
