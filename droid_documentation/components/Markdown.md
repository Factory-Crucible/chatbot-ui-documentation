## `components/Markdown` Directory

The `components/Markdown` directory plays a crucial role in the chatbot-ui project by providing the functionality to render markdown content and display code blocks in markdown format. This directory contains two TypeScript component files, `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx` and `CodeBlock.tsx`, each serving a specific purpose in the project. The `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx` file exports a memoized functional component that uses the `react-markdown` library to render markdown content, while the `CodeBlock.tsx` file exports a functional component that displays code blocks in markdown format. These components are integral to the project as they enhance the user interface by providing a visually appealing and efficient way to display markdown content and code blocks.

### Contents

The `components/Markdown` directory is composed of two TypeScript component files:

- `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx`: This file exports a memoized functional component named `MemoizedReactMarkdown` that uses the `react-markdown` library to render markdown content. The component is memoized using React's `memo` function to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
- `CodeBlock.tsx`: This file exports a functional component named `CodeBlock` which is used to display code blocks in a markdown format. The component uses `react-syntax-highlighter` for syntax highlighting and provides functionality to copy the code to clipboard and download the code as a file.

### Key Components

The `components/Markdown` directory houses two key components:

- `MemoizedReactMarkdown`: This component is crucial as it renders markdown content in the chatbot-ui project. By using React's `memo` function, it optimizes performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the project.
- `CodeBlock`: This component is responsible for displaying code blocks in markdown format. It uses `react-syntax-highlighter` for syntax highlighting, which enhances the readability of the code. Additionally, it provides functionality to copy the code to clipboard and download the code as a file, thereby improving the user experience.

### Usage & Examples

The components in the `components/Markdown` directory are used throughout the chatbot-ui project to render markdown content and display code blocks in markdown format.

For instance, the `MemoizedReactMarkdown` component could be used in a scenario where markdown content needs to be displayed in the user interface. The component would take the markdown content as a prop and render it efficiently, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

Similarly, the `CodeBlock` component could be used in a scenario where a code block needs to be displayed in markdown format. The component would take the programming language and the actual code as props, and display the code block with syntax highlighting. It would also provide the functionality to copy the code to clipboard and download the code as a file.

Please note that the above examples are hypothetical and may not represent the actual usage patterns in the chatbot-ui project.
