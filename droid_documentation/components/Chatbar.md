## components/Chatbar

The `components/Chatbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It is responsible for managing the chat bar of the application, which is a key user interface element. The chat bar is where users interact with the chatbot, manage conversations, and adjust settings. The directory contains three TypeScript files and a subdirectory, each playing a unique role in the functionality of the chat bar. The TypeScript files define the state, context, and structure of the Chatbar component, while the subdirectory contains additional components used within the chat bar.

### Contents

The `components/Chatbar` directory contains three TypeScript files and one subdirectory:

- `Chatbar.state.tsx`: This file defines the initial state for the Chatbar component, including a search term and a list of filtered conversations.
- `Chatbar.tsx`: This is a React component representing the chat bar, with handlers for various actions like changing API keys and managing conversations.
- `Chatbar.context.tsx`: This file defines the context for the Chatbar component, including the state, dispatch function, and several handler functions.
- `components/Chatbar/components`: This subdirectory contains six TypeScript files, each exporting a React component used in the chatbot UI. These components handle settings, conversations, chat folders, and plugin keys.

### Key Components

The `components/Chatbar` directory contains several key components that contribute to the functionality of the chatbot UI:

- `Chatbar.tsx`: This component is the main interface for the chat bar. It uses several hooks for state and context management and defines handlers for different actions such as changing API keys, handling plugin keys, exporting and importing data, clearing conversations, deleting conversations, and toggling the chat bar.

- `Chatbar.context.tsx`: This file provides the context for the Chatbar component, which is crucial for managing state and handling actions within the component.

- `components/Chatbar/components`: This subdirectory contains several components that are used within the chat bar, such as `ChatbarSettings.tsx` for managing settings, `Conversations.tsx` for displaying conversations, and `PluginKeys.tsx` for managing plugin keys.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `components/Chatbar` directory are used to manage the chat bar of the chatbot UI. For example, the `Chatbar.tsx` component is used to render the chat bar, which includes a search bar for filtering conversations, a list of conversations, and a settings button for managing API keys and other settings.

The `Chatbar.state.tsx` file is used to define the initial state for the Chatbar component. This state includes a search term and a list of filtered conversations. For instance, when a user types a term into the search bar, the `searchTerm` state variable is updated, and the list of conversations is filtered based on this term.

The `Chatbar.context.tsx` file provides the context for the Chatbar component. This context includes the state, a dispatch function for updating the state, and several handler functions for managing conversations, exporting and importing data, and handling changes to plugin keys and API keys. Other components within the `components/Chatbar` directory, such as `ChatbarSettings.tsx` and `Conversations.tsx`, use this context to access and manipulate the state and handlers.

The `components/Chatbar/components` subdirectory contains several components that are used within the chat bar. For example, the `ChatbarSettings.tsx` component provides a settings interface with options to clear conversations, import/export data, and change API keys. The `Conversations.tsx` component displays a list of individual conversations not part of any folder. The `PluginKeys.tsx` component manages the keys for various plugins, allowing the user to enter their Google API Key and Google CSE ID for the Google Search Plugin.
