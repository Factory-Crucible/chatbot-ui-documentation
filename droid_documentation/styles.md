## Styles Directory

The Styles directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses the global styles that are applied throughout the project, ensuring a consistent look and feel across all components and pages. The directory contains a single file, 'globals.css', which is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file that defines these global styles. The styles are primarily based on the Tailwind CSS framework, a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs. The 'globals.css' file also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar and the HTML document's background color. It also contains media queries and specific style rules for certain HTML elements, ensuring the project's responsive design.

### Contents

The Styles directory is straightforward in its structure, containing only one file:

- `globals.css`: This file holds the global styles for the project. It imports base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework and includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. The file also sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade. It contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Additionally, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Key Components

The key component in the Styles directory is the 'globals.css' file. This file is critical as it defines the global styles that are applied throughout the project. It ensures a consistent look and feel across all components and pages, which is crucial for a seamless user experience. The file is based on the Tailwind CSS framework, which provides a set of utility classes for building custom designs. The 'globals.css' file also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar and the HTML document's background color, ensuring the project's aesthetic appeal. It also contains media queries and specific style rules for certain HTML elements, ensuring the project's responsive design.

### Usage & Examples

The 'globals.css' file in the Styles directory is used to define the global styles for the project. These styles are applied throughout the project, ensuring a consistent look and feel across all components and pages. The file is included in the project's build process, and the styles it defines are applied to the final output.

For example, the 'globals.css' file sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade. This means that all pages in the project will have a dark background color, unless overridden by more specific styles.

The file also includes a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px. This media query adjusts the width of 'pre' elements under this condition, ensuring that the project's design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

Additionally, the 'globals.css' file removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'. This specific style rule ensures that code blocks are displayed correctly in the project.
