## Types Directory

The `types` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses TypeScript files that define various interfaces, types, and constants used throughout the project. These definitions provide a consistent structure for data and ensure type safety, which is a key aspect of TypeScript. The types defined in this directory are used in various parts of the application, including components, pages, hooks, and services. They help in structuring data related to different aspects of the application such as settings, data pairs, prompts, plugins, chat systems, environment variables, local storage schema, error messages, folders, export functionality, and interactions with Google's services and OpenAI models.

### Contents

The `types` directory contains several TypeScript files, each serving a specific purpose. There are no subdirectories in this directory. The files in this directory include:

- `data.ts`: Defines a key-value pair structure.
- `prompt.ts`: Outlines a prompt object.
- `plugin.ts`: Defines structures for plugins.
- `settings.ts`: Defines theme settings.
- `storage.ts`: Defines the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.
- `openai.ts`: Defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers.
- `chat.ts`: Defines structures for chat systems.
- `export.ts`: Relates to the application's export functionality.
- `google.ts`: Structures data related to Google's services.
- `folder.ts`: Defines a 'Folder' object.
- `index.ts`: An empty placeholder file.
- `error.ts`: Structures error messages.
- `env.ts`: Represents environment variables for the OpenAI API.

### Key Components

The `types` directory contains several key TypeScript files that define important structures used throughout the codebase. 

- `settings.ts`: This file defines the 'Settings' interface which is used to specify the theme settings for the application. It ensures consistent usage of the theme settings across the application.

- `storage.ts`: This file defines the 'LocalStorage' interface which structures the local storage schema for a chatbot UI. It is crucial for managing local data storage in the application.

- `openai.ts`: This file defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers. It is essential for interactions with the OpenAI API.

- `chat.ts`: This file defines various interfaces and types related to a chat system. It is key to managing chat conversations in the application.

- `export.ts`: This file defines various types and interfaces related to the export functionality of the application. It is important for managing data export in different formats.

### Usage & Examples

The TypeScript files in the `types` directory are used throughout the codebase to provide type definitions and ensure type safety. Here are some examples of how these files are used:

- `settings.ts`: The 'Settings' interface defined in this file is used to specify the theme settings for the application. For example, it could be used in a function that toggles the theme between 'light' and 'dark'.

- `storage.ts`: The 'LocalStorage' interface defined in this file is used to structure the local storage schema for a chatbot UI. For instance, it could be used when saving or retrieving data from local storage.

- `openai.ts`: The 'OpenAIModel' interface and 'OpenAIModelID' enumeration defined in this file are used when interacting with the OpenAI API. For example, they could be used when making a POST request to the '/api/models' endpoint.

- `chat.ts`: The 'Message', 'Role', 'ChatBody', and 'Conversation' interfaces defined in this file are used in managing chat conversations. For instance, they could be used when sending a new message or retrieving a conversation history.

- `export.ts`: The 'SupportedExportFormats' and 'LatestExportFormat' types, and the 'ConversationV1', 'ChatFolder', 'ExportFormatV2', 'ExportFormatV3', and 'ExportFormatV4' interfaces defined in this file are used in the export functionality of the application. For example, they could be used when exporting a conversation history in a specific format.
