## components/Folder

The `components/Folder` directory is a part of the chatbot-ui project's component structure, specifically designed to represent a folder in a file system within the user interface. This directory contains two main files, `Folder.tsx` and `index.ts`, which work together to provide a reusable and interactive Folder component. The Folder component is a critical part of the chatbot-ui's file system representation, providing functionality for renaming, deleting, and handling drag and drop events for folders.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. The Folder component represents a folder in a file system, providing interactive functionality and state management for each folder instance in the user interface.
- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Folder` component, defined and exported in the `Folder.tsx` file. This component is crucial to the chatbot-ui project as it provides the interactive representation of a folder in the file system. It accepts several props, maintains its own state, and renders a button and an input field. The component also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the chatbot-ui project to represent a folder in the file system. It is a reusable component that can be instantiated with different props to represent different folders. The component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Folder` component might be used:

```typescript
import Folder from './components/Folder';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const currentFolder = { /* folder data */ };
  const searchTerm = 'my search term';
  const handleDrop = (e, folder) => { /* handle drop event */ };
  const folderComponent = [ /* list of folder components */ ];

  return (
    <Folder
      currentFolder={currentFolder}
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      handleDrop={handleDrop}
      folderComponent={folderComponent}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example, the `Folder` component is imported and used in another component, `MyComponent`. The `Folder` component is given several props, including `currentFolder`, `searchTerm`, `handleDrop`, and `folderComponent`. These props are used by the `Folder` component to manage its state and render the appropriate user interface.
