## Styles Directory

The `styles` directory is a dedicated space for the global styling of the `chatbot-ui` project. It houses a single file, `globals.css`, which is responsible for defining the overall aesthetic and layout of the application. This file is a critical part of the project as it ensures consistency in the visual elements across the application. It leverages the Tailwind CSS framework, a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development, and includes custom styles for specific elements and conditions.

### Contents

The `styles` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing only one file:

- `globals.css`: This is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file that defines the global styles for the project. It is the backbone of the project's visual design, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application.

### Key Components

The `globals.css` file is the key component in this directory. It serves as the central location for defining the global styles of the project. The file imports base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework, providing a robust set of styling utilities. It also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, enhancing the user experience on webkit-based browsers. The file sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade, establishing the overall theme of the application. It also contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, ensuring the application's responsiveness on smaller screens. Lastly, it modifies the padding of 'pre' elements containing a 'div' with the class 'codeblock', providing a tailored style for these specific elements.

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file is used to define the global styles for the project. It is included in the project's build process, ensuring that the defined styles are applied across the application. The file is written in CSS, a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.

The file begins by importing base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework. This provides a wide range of utility classes for rapid UI development:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss/base';
@import 'tailwindcss/components';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';
```

It then defines custom styles for the webkit scrollbar:

```css
::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 8px;
}
::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  background: #1a1b27;
}
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: #4e4f5c;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover {
  background: #60616f;
}
```

The file also sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade:

```css
html {
  background-color: #1a1b27;
}
```

It includes a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition:

```css
@media (max-width: 720px) {
  pre {
    width: auto;
  }
}
```

Lastly, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock':

```css
pre > div.codeblock {
  padding: 0;
}
```
