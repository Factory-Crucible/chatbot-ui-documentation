Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the codebase and the documentation. These docs are generated and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes by the Documentation Droid.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to provide a user interface for a chatbot application. It is a Docker-based Node.js project that uses TypeScript and React. The repository fits into the bigger picture as a standalone microservice that interacts with other services, such as OpenAI and Google APIs, to generate prompts and send responses.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies:

- Docker: Used for creating a Docker image and defining and managing the Docker application.
- Node.js: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- Kubernetes: Used for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components:

- Frontend Library: The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different component of the chatbot UI.
- Backend Library: The 'api' subdirectory within the 'pages' directory handles API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs.
- CLI: The 'Makefile' provides a command-line interface for managing the project.

### Conventions

The codebase follows several conventions:

- File Naming: TypeScript files use the '.ts' or '.tsx' extension. Test files use the '.test.ts' extension.
- Directory Structure: Each major component of the project has its own directory. Utility functions are stored in the 'utils' directory, types are defined in the 'types' directory, and tests are located in the '__tests__' directory.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. Here is a high-level overview of the directory structure:

```
.
├── __tests__
├── components
├── droid_documentation
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
├── public
├── services
├── styles
├── types
└── utils
```

- The '__tests__' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.
- The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project.
- The 'droid_documentation' directory contains detailed documentation for the project.
- The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks.
- The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations.
- The 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests.
- The 'public' directory contains branding files and a 'screenshots' subdirectory.
- The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls.
- The 'styles' directory contains a single file, 'globals.css', that holds the global styles for the project.
- The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants.
- The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project.

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the chatbot UI. The user interacts with the UI, triggering API calls to OpenAI and Google APIs. The responses from these APIs are then processed and displayed in the UI. The 'pages/api/chat.ts' file serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality, processing requests, encoding messages, and interacting with an OpenAI service. The 'pages/api/google.ts' file handles API requests and responses, interacting with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API to generate prompts and send responses.

### System Connections

The system interacts with external services, specifically OpenAI and Google APIs. The 'pages/api/models.ts' file handles requests related to OpenAI models, constructing URLs and fetching data from the OpenAI API. The 'pages/api/google.ts' file interacts with the Google Custom Search API to generate prompts.

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows several testing principles. Tests are located in the '__tests__' directory, with a 'utils' subdirectory serving as a testing suite. The 'importExports.test.ts' file validates the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. It also tests a function named 'cleanData', which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.
