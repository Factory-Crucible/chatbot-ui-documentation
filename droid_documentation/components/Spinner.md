# `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The Spinner component is a crucial part of the user experience, providing users with a visual cue that the application is processing data or waiting for a response.

## Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component, exporting the default export from `Spinner.tsx`. This setup simplifies imports elsewhere in the project, as the Spinner component can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` without specifying the `Spinner.tsx` file.
- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component, which displays a spinning animation typically used to indicate a loading state. It accepts 'size' and 'className' as optional props, with 'size' controlling the spinner's dimensions and 'className' allowing for additional CSS classes. The spinner is created using SVG and includes an animation for the spinning effect.

The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

## Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Spinner.tsx` file. This file defines the Spinner component, a crucial part of the user interface that provides a visual cue to the user when the application is processing data or waiting for a response. The Spinner component is created using SVG and includes an animation for the spinning effect. It accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop controls the spinner's dimensions, while the 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner.

## Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate a loading state. It can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` thanks to the `index.ts` file, which exports the default export from `Spinner.tsx`.

For example, the Spinner component might be used in a situation where the application is waiting for a response from an API. The Spinner would be displayed while the application is waiting for the response, providing a visual cue to the user that the application is processing data.

The usage of the Spinner component might look something like this:

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

// ...

return (
  <div>
    {isLoading ? <Spinner size="2em" className="my-spinner" /> : <div>Data loaded</div>}
  </div>
);
```

In this example, the Spinner component is displayed if the `isLoading` variable is true. The Spinner's size is set to '2em', and it is given an additional CSS class of 'my-spinner'.
