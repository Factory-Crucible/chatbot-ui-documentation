## The 'styles' Directory

The 'styles' directory serves as the central hub for the project's global styling. It is home to the 'globals.css' file, which is a critical component in defining the overall look and feel of the project. This file leverages the power of the Tailwind CSS framework, a utility-first CSS framework, to import base, components, and utilities. It also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar and sets the HTML document's background color. The 'globals.css' file is designed to be responsive, with a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. It also includes specific styles for 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock', removing their padding. The 'styles' directory does not contain any subdirectories, keeping the global styles centralized and easily accessible.
