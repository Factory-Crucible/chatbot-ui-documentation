## `components/Folder` Directory

The `components/Folder` directory is a dedicated space for the `Folder` component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a representation of a folder in a file system, providing an interactive user interface for managing folders within the chatbot. The `Folder` component is a critical part of the chatbot's user interface, allowing users to create, rename, and delete folders, as well as drag and drop items into folders.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. The `Folder` component represents a folder in a file system, providing an interactive user interface for managing folders. It accepts several props, maintains state, and renders a button and an input field. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.
- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is a key component in this directory. It exports the `Folder` component, which is a critical part of the chatbot's user interface. The `Folder` component allows users to interact with folders in the chatbot, providing functionality for creating, renaming, and deleting folders, as well as dragging and dropping items into folders.

The `index.ts` file, while not as complex as the `Folder.tsx` file, plays a crucial role in simplifying imports from this directory. By exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file, it allows other parts of the codebase to import the `Folder` component more easily.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to represent and manage folders. It is used in various parts of the user interface, allowing users to interact with folders in a seamless and efficient manner.

For example, when a user wants to create a new folder, they would interact with the `Folder` component. The component would handle the creation of the new folder, updating its state and rendering the new folder in the user interface.

Similarly, when a user wants to rename or delete a folder, they would interact with the `Folder` component. The component would handle the renaming or deletion of the folder, updating its state and rendering the changes in the user interface.

The `Folder` component also handles drag and drop events, allowing users to move items into folders by dragging and dropping them. This provides a more intuitive and efficient way for users to manage their items in the chatbot.
