# `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project, each responsible for a specific part of the user interface and functionality of the chatbot. The `components/Mobile` directory specifically contains files related to the mobile version of the application, focusing on the navigation bar functionality for the mobile chat application.

## Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is a simple structure with no subdirectories. It contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component named 'Navbar'. This component is designed specifically for the mobile application's navigation bar.

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines a functional component named 'Navbar' for the mobile application. The component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of a chat application. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation', which is an object of type 'Conversation', and 'onNewConversation', which is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button that, when clicked, triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

## Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the 'Navbar' functional component, which is a critical part of the mobile chat application's user interface. The 'Navbar' component is responsible for displaying the currently active chat conversation and providing an interface for initiating new conversations. This component is integral to the user experience on mobile devices, providing a seamless interface for chat navigation.

## Usage & Examples

The 'Navbar' component defined in the `Navbar.tsx` file is used within the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a functional component that accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'.

The 'selectedConversation' prop is an object of type 'Conversation' that represents the currently active chat. The 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated.

Here is a simplified example of how the 'Navbar' component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is the currently active chat conversation, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that handles the initiation of a new conversation. When the 'IconPlus' button within the 'Navbar' component is clicked, it triggers the `handleNewConversation` function, initiating a new conversation.
