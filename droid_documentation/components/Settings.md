## components/Settings

The `components/Settings` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the hub for managing application settings. It contains three TypeScript React component files: `SettingDialog.tsx`, `Import.tsx`, and `Key.tsx`. These components are responsible for managing the settings dialog, import functionality, and API key settings respectively. They work in tandem to provide a seamless user experience, allowing users to customize the application to their preferences, import data, and manage API keys.

### Contents

The `components/Settings` directory contains the following files:

- `SettingDialog.tsx`: This file exports a functional component that manages a settings dialog. It allows users to change the application theme and handles outside clicks to close the dialog.
- `Import.tsx`: This file provides an import functionality. It renders a file input and a button that triggers the file picker. It reads the selected file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls a function with the parsed data.
- `Key.tsx`: This file manages the API key settings. It maintains a local state for the key and a flag indicating if the key is being changed. It handles key press events, updates the key when 'Enter' is pressed, and focuses on the input field when the key is being changed. It renders either an input field for changing the key or a button to initiate the change, depending on the state.

### Key Components

The key components in the `components/Settings` directory are the `SettingDialog.tsx`, `Import.tsx`, and `Key.tsx` files. 

- `SettingDialog.tsx` is a critical component as it provides the interface for users to customize the application theme. It fetches the current settings using the `getSettings` utility function and saves the new settings using the `saveSettings` utility function. It also handles outside clicks to close the dialog, enhancing the user experience.
- `Import.tsx` is responsible for the import functionality of the application. It reads the selected file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls a function with the parsed data. This component is crucial for data import operations.
- `Key.tsx` manages the API key settings, a critical aspect of the application. It maintains a local state for the key and a flag indicating if the key is being changed. It handles key press events, updates the key when 'Enter' is pressed, and focuses on the input field when the key is being changed.

### Usage & Examples

The components in the `components/Settings` directory are used to manage various settings of the chatbot-ui application.

- `SettingDialog.tsx` is used to manage the settings dialog of the application. It is used when the user wants to change the application theme. The `open` prop determines whether the dialog is visible or not, and the `onClose` function is called when the dialog needs to be closed.
- `Import.tsx` is used to import data into the application. It accepts a prop `onImport` which is a function that takes a parameter of type `SupportedExportFormats`. When a file is selected, it reads the file as text and parses it as JSON, then calls the `onImport` function with the parsed data.
- `Key.tsx` is used to manage the API key settings of the application. It accepts two props: `apiKey` and `onApiKeyChange`. The `apiKey` prop is the current API key, and the `onApiKeyChange` function is called when the API key needs to be updated.
