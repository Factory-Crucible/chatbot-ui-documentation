## components/Markdown Directory

The `components/Markdown` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to handling markdown rendering within the chatbot UI. It contains two TypeScript component files, `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx` and `CodeBlock.tsx`, which are responsible for rendering markdown content and displaying code blocks in markdown format, respectively. These components are integral to the chatbot UI's ability to display rich text content and code snippets, enhancing the user experience and providing a more interactive interface.

### Contents

The `components/Markdown` directory contains the following files:

- `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx`: This TypeScript component file exports a memoized functional component named 'MemoizedReactMarkdown'. It uses the 'react-markdown' library to render markdown content and optimizes performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
- `CodeBlock.tsx`: This TypeScript component file exports a functional component named 'CodeBlock'. It is used to display code blocks in markdown format, with syntax highlighting provided by 'react-syntax-highlighter'. It also includes functionality to copy the code to clipboard and download the code as a file.

### Key Components

The `components/Markdown` directory houses two key components that contribute significantly to the functionality of the chatbot UI:

- `MemoizedReactMarkdown`: This component is responsible for rendering markdown content within the chatbot UI. It uses the 'react-markdown' library to convert markdown syntax into HTML, allowing for rich text formatting in the chatbot's responses. The component is memoized to optimize performance, ensuring that the chatbot UI remains responsive and efficient.
- `CodeBlock`: This component is used to display code blocks within the chatbot UI. It supports syntax highlighting for a variety of programming languages, enhancing readability and comprehension. The component also provides options to copy the code to clipboard and download the code as a file, offering additional convenience for users who wish to reuse the code snippets.

### Usage & Examples

The components in the `components/Markdown` directory are used throughout the chatbot UI to render markdown content and display code blocks. They are typically used in conjunction with other components to display the chatbot's responses, which may include rich text formatting and code snippets.

For example, the `MemoizedReactMarkdown` component might be used to render a chatbot response that includes markdown syntax, such as bold text or bullet points. The component would take the markdown content as a prop and return the corresponding HTML.

The `CodeBlock` component might be used to display a code snippet in a chatbot response. The component would take the programming language and the code as props, and return a code block with syntax highlighting. It would also provide options to copy the code to clipboard and download the code as a file.

Please note that these examples are illustrative and may not represent the exact usage patterns in the codebase. Always refer to the actual code for the most accurate information.
