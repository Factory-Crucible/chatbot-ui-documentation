## components/Chatbar

The `components/Chatbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It contains TypeScript files and a subdirectory that together form the Chatbar component of the chatbot user interface. The Chatbar component is responsible for managing the chat bar of the application, including the state of the chat bar, handling various actions like changing API keys, managing conversations, and providing the context for the Chatbar component. The subdirectory `components/Chatbar/components` contains additional components that handle settings, conversations, chat folders, and plugin keys.

### Contents

The `components/Chatbar` directory contains three TypeScript files and a subdirectory:

- `Chatbar.state.tsx`: This file sets the initial state for the Chatbar component, including a search term and a list of filtered conversations.
- `Chatbar.tsx`: This is a React component representing the chat bar, with handlers for various actions like changing API keys and managing conversations.
- `Chatbar.context.tsx`: This file defines the context for the Chatbar component, including the state, dispatch function, and several handler functions.
- `components/Chatbar/components`: This subdirectory contains six TypeScript files, each exporting a React component used in the chatbot UI.

### Key Components

The key components in the `components/Chatbar` directory are the `Chatbar.tsx` and `Chatbar.context.tsx` files. 

- `Chatbar.tsx` is a React component that represents the chat bar of the chatbot application. It defines several handlers for different actions such as changing API keys, handling plugin keys, exporting and importing data, clearing conversations, deleting conversations, and toggling the chat bar. These handlers interact with both local and global state, and also make use of local storage.
- `Chatbar.context.tsx` defines the context for the Chatbar component, including the state, dispatch function, and several handler functions for managing conversations, exporting and importing data, and handling changes to plugin keys and API keys. The context is then created using React's createContext function with the 'ChatbarContextProps' interface, and exported for use in other components.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `components/Chatbar` directory are used to manage the chat bar of the chatbot application. For example, the `Chatbar.tsx` file defines a `Chatbar` component that uses several hooks for state and context management. It defines several handlers for different actions such as changing API keys, handling plugin keys, exporting and importing data, clearing conversations, deleting conversations, and toggling the chat bar. These handlers interact with both local and global state, and also make use of local storage.

The `Chatbar.context.tsx` file defines the context for the Chatbar component, including the state, dispatch function, and several handler functions. This context is used by other components to access and manipulate the state of the Chatbar component.

The `components/Chatbar/components` subdirectory contains several components that are used in the chatbot UI. For example, the `ChatbarSettings.tsx` component provides the settings interface for the chatbar, including options to clear conversations, import/export data, and change API keys. The `Conversations.tsx` component displays a list of individual conversations not part of any folder. The `ChatFolders.tsx` component manages the display of chat folders, handling the dropping of conversations into folders.
