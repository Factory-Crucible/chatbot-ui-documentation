# Directory Overview: components

The `components` directory is a key part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository, serving as the codebase for the chatbot UI's components. Each subdirectory within `components` houses a specific part of the project, including the Sidebar, Settings, Buttons, Chatbar, Chat, Markdown, Folder, Spinner, Promptbar, Search, and Mobile components. Each of these components is responsible for a specific part of the user interface and functionality of the chatbot.

## Contents

The `components` directory is a collection of subdirectories, each dedicated to a specific component of the chatbot UI. These components range from the Sidebar, which provides navigation and settings management, to the Chatbar, which handles user input and chat management. Other components include the Markdown component for rendering markdown content, the Spinner component for indicating loading states, and the Mobile component for managing the mobile application's navigation bar. Each component is designed to be modular and reusable, contributing to the overall functionality, scalability, and reliability of the chatbot UI.
