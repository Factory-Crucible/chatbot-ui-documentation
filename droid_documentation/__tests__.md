## **tests** Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the `chatbot-ui` project. It is structured to mirror the main codebase, allowing for a clear and organized approach to testing. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within `utils`, there's another subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

### Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- `utils`: This subdirectory serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. It contains a subdirectory named `app`.
  
  - `app`: This subdirectory houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.
    
    - `importExports.test.ts`: This is a test file for utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It verifies different versions of the export format, ensuring that a given object matches the expected format for each version. The file also tests the 'cleanData' function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest one, and checks that the cleaned data aligns with the expected structure of the latest format.

### Key Components

The key component in the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file. This file plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of the import and export operations in the application. It tests the `cleanData` function, which is responsible for updating data from older export formats to the latest one. By validating the structure and format of the exported data, it helps maintain the consistency and reliability of the data handling in the application.

### Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house the test suites for the application. The structure of the directory mirrors the main codebase, allowing for an organized approach to testing. For example, the `importExports.test.ts` file within the `app` subdirectory of `utils` tests the import and export operations of the application. It includes tests for different versions of the export format and the `cleanData` function. The tests are written using the Jest testing framework, with each test case enclosed in a `describe` and `it` block. For instance, the test for the `cleanData` function might look like this:

```typescript
describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
  describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {
    it('should return the latest format', () => {
      // Test implementation here
    });
  });
});
```

This example demonstrates how the tests are structured in the `importExports.test.ts` file. Each version of the export format has its own `describe` block, and each specific test case is enclosed in an `it` block. This structure allows for clear and organized test cases, making it easier to understand what each test is validating.
