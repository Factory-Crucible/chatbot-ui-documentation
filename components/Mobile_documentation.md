## `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the `integration-chatbot-ui` project's codebase, dedicated to housing TypeScript files for mobile-specific components in the React application. This directory is crucial for ensuring that the application provides a seamless and optimized user experience across different device types, particularly mobile devices. The components within this directory are designed with mobile usability in mind, taking into account factors such as screen size, touch interfaces, and mobile navigation patterns.

### Contents

Currently, the `components/Mobile` directory contains a single TypeScript file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This file defines a functional React component named `Navbar` that is tailored for mobile use. The `Navbar` component accepts two props: `selectedConversation`, which is of type `Conversation`, and `onNewConversation`, a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is initiated. The component renders a navigation bar displaying the `selectedConversation` name and an `IconPlus` icon from the `@tabler/icons-react` library. When the `IconPlus` icon is clicked, it calls the `onNewConversation` function.

### Folder Structure Overview

The `components/Mobile` directory is a straightforward and lean structure, currently containing only one file. This simplicity is by design, as it allows for easy navigation and understanding of the directory's contents. As the application evolves and the need for more mobile-specific components arises, this directory can be expanded with additional files or even subdirectories, if necessary, to maintain an organized structure.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Navbar.tsx` file. This file defines the `Navbar` component, a critical part of the mobile user interface. The `Navbar` component is responsible for rendering the navigation bar on mobile devices, displaying the currently selected conversation and providing an option to initiate a new conversation. Here is a brief overview of its structure:

```typescript
interface Props {
  selectedConversation: Conversation;
  onNewConversation: () => void;
}

export const Navbar: FC<Props> = ({
  selectedConversation,
  onNewConversation,
}) => {};
```

### Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the application to provide a mobile-friendly navigation bar. It is likely to be included in the main layout of the mobile application, ensuring its presence across different pages.

The `Navbar` component accepts two props:

- `selectedConversation`: This prop is of type `Conversation` and represents the currently active or selected conversation in the chat interface.
- `onNewConversation`: This is a function prop that gets triggered when the user initiates a new conversation. This could be tied to a state update function or a function that performs API calls, depending on the application's data handling strategy.

An example usage of the `Navbar` component might look like this:

```jsx
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` would be a state variable representing the current conversation, and `handleNewConversation` would be a function that handles the creation of a new conversation.
