## __tests__ Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation project. It is structured to mirror the main codebase, allowing for a clear and organized approach to testing. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within `utils`, there's another subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

### Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- `__tests__/utils`: This directory serves as a testing suite for utility functions within the application. It contains a subdirectory named `app`.

- `__tests__/utils/app`: This directory contains test files for the application's utility functions. Specifically, it includes a file named `importExports.test.ts`.

- `__tests__/utils/app/importExports.test.ts`: This is a test file for utility functions related to import and export operations in the application.

### Key Components

The key component in the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file. This file tests the functionality of import and export operations, ensuring that exported objects align with the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one. The test checks that the updated data matches the expected structure of the current format.

### Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house all the tests for the application. The structure of the directory mirrors the main codebase, allowing for a clear and organized approach to testing. For example, the `__tests__/utils/app/importExports.test.ts` file tests the utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It verifies different versions of the export format, ensuring that a given object matches the expected format for each version. The file also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest one, and checks that the cleaned data aligns with the expected structure of the latest format.

Here is a simplified example of how the `importExports.test.ts` file might be structured:

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  // Tests for different versions of the export format
});

describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
  // Tests for the 'cleanData' function
});
```

This example shows the high-level structure of the test file, with separate `describe` blocks for testing the export format functions and the `cleanData` function. Each `describe` block would contain multiple `it` blocks for individual tests.
