## Styles Directory

The Styles directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses the global styles that are applied across the entire project. The directory contains a single file, 'globals.css', which is responsible for defining the look and feel of the application. This file is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file that contains global styles for the project. It includes the import of base, components, and utilities from Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The file also contains custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, including its track, thumb, and corner, with different styles for hover states. It sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade. Additionally, it contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Lastly, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Contents

The Styles directory is straightforward in its structure, containing only a single file, 'globals.css'. This file holds all the global styles that are applied throughout the project. It does not contain any subdirectories, keeping the directory simple and focused on its purpose.

- `globals.css`: This is a CSS file that holds the global styles for the project. It imports base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework and includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. The file also sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade.

Additionally, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Key Components

The key component in the Styles directory is the 'globals.css' file. This file is responsible for defining the global styles that are applied across the entire project. It is a critical part of the codebase as it ensures consistency in the appearance of the application. The 'globals.css' file is a comprehensive stylesheet that includes imports from the Tailwind CSS framework, custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, media queries for responsive design, and specific style rules for certain HTML elements.

### Usage & Examples

The 'globals.css' file in the Styles directory is used to apply global styles across the entire project. It is included in the project's build process, ensuring that the styles it defines are applied to every page of the application. The file is written in CSS, a stylesheet language used for describing the look and feel of a document written in HTML.

For example, the file includes a rule that sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade. This means that every page of the application will have a dark background color. Similarly, the file includes a media query that adjusts the width of 'pre' elements for screens with a maximum width of 720px. This ensures that 'pre' elements are displayed correctly on smaller screens.

The 'globals.css' file also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. These styles are applied to the scrollbar in webkit-based browsers, ensuring a consistent look and feel across different browsers. The file also removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock', ensuring that code blocks are displayed correctly.
