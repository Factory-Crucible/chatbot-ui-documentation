## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui's React application. It houses the TypeScript files and a subdirectory that collectively form the 'Promptbar' component. The 'Promptbar' component is a sidebar in the user interface, responsible for managing prompts and folders. The directory's structure and the interplay of its contents contribute to the functionality of the 'Promptbar' component.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: Serves as the entry point, exporting the 'Promptbar' component.
- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: Defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: The main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: Defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.
- `components/Promptbar/components`: A subdirectory containing related components.

### Key Components

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several key files:

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This file is crucial as it defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component. It outlines the shape of the context, including the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file for the 'Promptbar'. It represents a sidebar in the UI and contains functions for managing prompts and folders, making it a central part of the 'Promptbar' functionality.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to build and manage the 'Promptbar' component of the chatbot-ui. For instance, the `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is used to define the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. This context is then used in other parts of the application.

The `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file for the 'Promptbar'. It represents a sidebar in the UI and contains functions for managing prompts and folders. These functions are used to handle user interactions with the 'Promptbar', such as creating, deleting, and updating prompts.

The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component. This state is used to manage the 'Promptbar' component's data and behavior.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory contains several related components. These components are used to build various parts of the 'Promptbar' component, such as the list of prompts, the 'Promptbar' settings, and the modal for editing prompts.
