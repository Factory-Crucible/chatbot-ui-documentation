## `components/Markdown` Directory

The `components/Markdown` directory is a part of the `integration-chatbot-ui` project's codebase. This directory is dedicated to housing components that handle the rendering of Markdown content within the application. It contains two TypeScript files, each exporting a distinct React component. These components are used to display Markdown content and syntax-highlighted code blocks within the application.

### Contents

The `components/Markdown` directory contains the following files:

- `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx`: This TypeScript file exports a memoized version of the `ReactMarkdown` component. The memoization is achieved using the `memo` function from React, which prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the `children` prop between renders. This component accepts `Options` as its props, which are passed to the underlying `ReactMarkdown` component.

- `CodeBlock.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines a `CodeBlock` component that uses the `react-syntax-highlighter` library to display syntax-highlighted code blocks. The component accepts `language` and `value` props to determine the programming language and the code to be displayed, respectively. It also supports code copying and downloading, with file names generated by a `generateRandomString` utility function. The component uses `next-i18next` for internationalization.

### Folder Structure Overview

The `components/Markdown` directory is a flat structure with no subdirectories. It contains two TypeScript files, each exporting a distinct React component. The components are organized based on their functionality, with each file named after the component it exports.

### Key Components

The `components/Markdown` directory contains two key components:

- [`MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx`](https://github.com/Factory-Crucible/integration-chatbot-ui/blob/main/components/Markdown/MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx): This component is a memoized version of the `ReactMarkdown` component, which prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the `children` prop between renders.

- [`CodeBlock.tsx`](https://github.com/Factory-Crucible/integration-chatbot-ui/blob/main/components/Markdown/CodeBlock.tsx): This component uses the `react-syntax-highlighter` library to display syntax-highlighted code blocks. It also supports code copying and downloading, with file names generated by a `generateRandomString` utility function.

### Usage & Examples

The components in the `components/Markdown` directory are used throughout the `integration-chatbot-ui` project to render Markdown content and syntax-highlighted code blocks.

For example, the `MemoizedReactMarkdown` component could be used to render a piece of Markdown content like this:

```jsx
<MemoizedReactMarkdown source={markdownContent} />
```

The `CodeBlock` component could be used to render a syntax-highlighted code block like this:

```jsx
<CodeBlock language="javascript" value={codeContent} />
```

In both examples, `markdownContent` and `codeContent` would be strings containing the Markdown content and code to be rendered, respectively.
