## Types Directory

The `types` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses TypeScript files that define various interfaces, types, and constants used throughout the project. These definitions provide a consistent structure for data and ensure type safety across the application. The directory is devoid of any subdirectories, focusing solely on providing a centralized location for type definitions.

### Contents

The `types` directory contains several TypeScript files, each serving a specific purpose in the codebase:

- `data.ts`: Defines a key-value pair structure.
- `prompt.ts`: Outlines a prompt object.
- `plugin.ts`: Defines structures for plugins.
- `settings.ts`: Defines theme settings.
- `storage.ts`: Defines the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.
- `openai.ts`: Defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers.
- `chat.ts`: Defines structures for chat systems.
- `export.ts`: Relates to the application's export functionality.
- `google.ts`: Structures data related to Google's services.
- `folder.ts`: Defines a 'Folder' object.
- `index.ts`: An empty placeholder file.
- `error.ts`: Structures error messages.
- `env.ts`: Represents environment variables for the OpenAI API.

### Key Components

Several files in the `types` directory play a critical role in the chatbot-ui project:

- `data.ts`: This file defines the `KeyValuePair` interface, which is likely used throughout the project wherever a key-value pair structure is needed.
- `prompt.ts`: This file defines the `Prompt` interface, providing a consistent structure for prompt objects throughout the codebase.
- `plugin.ts`: This file defines the structure and data for plugins in the application, including interfaces for a plugin and its key, enums for plugin identification and naming, and a record of all plugins.
- `storage.ts`: This file defines the `LocalStorage` interface, which structures the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.
- `openai.ts`: This file defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers, including an interface for an OpenAI model, an enum for model identifiers, and a record mapping model identifiers to their respective model details.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `types` directory are used throughout the chatbot-ui project to ensure type safety and data consistency. For instance, the `KeyValuePair` interface defined in `data.ts` might be used in a function that accepts a key-value pair as an argument:

```typescript
function processKeyValuePair(pair: KeyValuePair) {
  // Function body
}
```

Similarly, the `Prompt` interface defined in `prompt.ts` might be used in a function that creates a new prompt:

```typescript
function createPrompt(promptData: Prompt) {
  // Function body
}
```

The `LocalStorage` interface defined in `storage.ts` might be used when interacting with the local storage:

```typescript
let storage: LocalStorage;
// Interact with the local storage
```

The `OpenAIModel` interface and `OpenAIModelID` enum defined in `openai.ts` might be used when interacting with the OpenAI API:

```typescript
let model: OpenAIModel;
let modelID: OpenAIModelID;
// Interact with the OpenAI API
```
