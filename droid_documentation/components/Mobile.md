# `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a crucial part of the project's responsive design strategy, ensuring that the chatbot interface remains user-friendly and functional across different devices. The directory currently contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component for the mobile application's navigation bar.

## Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is a lean structure, containing only one file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines the `Navbar` functional component, which is specifically designed for the mobile application's navigation bar.

## Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the `Navbar` functional component, which is a critical part of the mobile user interface. This component is responsible for displaying the currently active chat and providing an interface for initiating new conversations.

### `Navbar.tsx`

The `Navbar` component is a functional component that accepts two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`. The `selectedConversation` prop is an object of type `Conversation` that represents the currently active chat. The `onNewConversation` prop is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started.

The `Navbar` component displays the name of the selected conversation and an `IconPlus` button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the `onNewConversation` function, allowing users to initiate new conversations from the mobile navigation bar.

## Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is typically rendered within the mobile layout component, providing a consistent navigation interface across different parts of the application.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
import { Navbar } from './components/Mobile/Navbar';

// ...

<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that initiates a new conversation. The `Navbar` component displays the name of the `currentConversation` and provides an `IconPlus` button for starting new conversations.
