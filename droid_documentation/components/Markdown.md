## `components/Markdown` Directory

The `components/Markdown` directory is a specialized section of the `components` directory, dedicated to handling markdown rendering within the chatbot UI. It contains two TypeScript component files, `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx` and `CodeBlock.tsx`, which are responsible for rendering markdown content and displaying code blocks in markdown format respectively. These components are integral to the chatbot UI's ability to display rich text content and code snippets, enhancing the user experience and providing a more interactive and informative interface.

### Contents

The `components/Markdown` directory is composed of two TypeScript files:

- `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx`: This file exports a memoized functional component named `MemoizedReactMarkdown` that uses the `react-markdown` library to render markdown content. The component is memoized to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders, particularly when the markdown content remains unchanged between renders.

- `CodeBlock.tsx`: This file exports a functional component named `CodeBlock` that is used to display code blocks in markdown format. The component uses `react-syntax-highlighter` for syntax highlighting and provides functionality to copy the code to clipboard and download the code as a file. The file name for download is generated using a utility function. The component also uses `next-i18next` for internationalization.

### Key Components

The `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx` and `CodeBlock.tsx` files are the key components in this directory:

- `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx`: This component is crucial for rendering markdown content within the chatbot UI. By using the `react-markdown` library, it allows for the display of rich text content, enhancing the user experience. The memoization of this component ensures that the performance of the chatbot UI remains optimal, even when dealing with large amounts of markdown content.

- `CodeBlock.tsx`: This component is responsible for displaying code blocks within the chatbot UI. It uses `react-syntax-highlighter` to provide syntax highlighting, making the code easier to read and understand. The ability to copy the code to clipboard and download the code as a file adds to the interactivity and usefulness of the chatbot UI, particularly for users who wish to reuse or analyze the code snippets.

### Usage & Examples

The `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx` and `CodeBlock.tsx` components are used throughout the chatbot UI to render markdown content and display code blocks respectively.

For instance, the `MemoizedReactMarkdown` component might be used to render a user's message that contains markdown formatting. The component would take the markdown content as a prop and render it into HTML, displaying the formatted text within the chatbot UI.

The `CodeBlock` component could be used to display a code snippet within a user's message. The component would take the programming language and the code as props, and use `react-syntax-highlighter` to display the code with appropriate syntax highlighting. The user would then have the option to copy the code to clipboard or download it as a file.
