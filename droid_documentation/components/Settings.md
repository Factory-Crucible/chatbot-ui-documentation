## components/Settings Directory

The `components/Settings` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the hub for managing the application's settings. This directory contains three TypeScript React component files: `SettingDialog.tsx`, `Import.tsx`, and `Key.tsx`. Each of these files exports a functional component that contributes to the settings management of the application. The components handle tasks such as managing a settings dialog, providing import functionality, and managing API key settings. These components are integral to the application's functionality, allowing users to customize their experience, import data, and manage their API keys.

### Contents

The `components/Settings` directory contains three TypeScript files:

- `SettingDialog.tsx`: This file exports a functional component that manages a settings dialog. The dialog allows users to change the application theme and handles outside clicks to close the dialog.
- `Import.tsx`: This file provides an import functionality, rendering a file input and a button that triggers the file picker. It reads the selected file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls a function with the parsed data.
- `Key.tsx`: This file manages the API key settings, maintaining a local state for the key and a flag indicating if the key is being changed. It handles key press events, updates the key when 'Enter' is pressed, and focuses on the input field when the key is being changed. It renders either an input field for changing the key or a button to initiate the change, depending on the state.

### Key Components

The `components/Settings` directory houses three key components that play a significant role in the chatbot-ui project:

- `SettingDialog`: This component manages the settings dialog, allowing users to change the application theme. It also handles outside clicks to close the dialog. This component is crucial for providing users with a customizable experience.
- `Import`: The `Import` component provides an import functionality for the application. It reads the selected file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls a function with the parsed data. This component is essential for importing data into the application.
- `Key`: The `Key` component manages the API key settings for the application. It maintains a local state for the key and a flag indicating if the key is being changed. This component is vital for managing the API keys used by the application.

### Usage & Examples

The components in the `components/Settings` directory are used within the chatbot-ui project to manage the application's settings. Here are some examples of how these components are used:

- `SettingDialog`: This component is used to manage the settings dialog. When the user clicks on the settings button, the `SettingDialog` component is rendered, allowing the user to change the application theme. The component also handles outside clicks to close the dialog.
- `Import`: The `Import` component is used to provide an import functionality for the application. When the user clicks on the import button, the `Import` component is rendered, allowing the user to select a file to import. The component reads the selected file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls a function with the parsed data.
- `Key`: The `Key` component is used to manage the API key settings for the application. When the user wants to change their API key, the `Key` component is rendered, allowing the user to input their new key. The component handles key press events, updates the key when 'Enter' is pressed, and focuses on the input field when the key is being changed.
