# `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is an integral part of the project's modular architecture, focusing on the mobile-specific components. Currently, it houses a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component for the mobile application's navigation bar. This component, named 'Navbar', is specifically designed for the mobile interface of the chatbot application, providing a seamless user experience for mobile users.

## Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing a single TypeScript file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This file defines the 'Navbar' functional component, which is used in the mobile version of the chatbot application. It is responsible for rendering the navigation bar and handling user interactions related to chat conversations.

## Key Components

The `components/Mobile` directory is centered around the `Navbar.tsx` file, which is a critical part of the mobile interface of the chatbot application:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines the 'Navbar' functional component. The component accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The 'selectedConversation' prop is an object of type 'Conversation' that represents the currently active chat. The 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

## Usage & Examples

The `Navbar.tsx` file in the `components/Mobile` directory is used to render the navigation bar in the mobile version of the chatbot application. It is a functional component that accepts two props and uses them to display the name of the currently selected conversation and provide a way to initiate a new conversation.

Here is a simplified example of how the 'Navbar' component might be used in the application:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object of type 'Conversation' that represents the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The 'Navbar' component displays the name of the `currentConversation` and an 'IconPlus' button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the `handleNewConversation` function, initiating a new conversation.
