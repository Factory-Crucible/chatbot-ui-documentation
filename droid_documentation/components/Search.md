## components/Search

The `components/Search` directory is dedicated to the Search component of the chatbot user interface. This component is responsible for providing a search functionality within the chatbot, allowing users to input search terms and perform searches. The directory contains two main files: `Search.tsx` and `index.ts`.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains the following files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that exports a functional component named 'Search'. The component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' represents the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input when clicked.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the directory, exporting the default from 'Search.tsx'. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory.

### Key Components

- `Search.tsx`: This file is the heart of the Search component. It defines the structure and behavior of the component, including the rendering of the search input field and the 'X' icon, and the handling of user interactions. The 'Search' component is a key part of the chatbot user interface, enabling users to perform searches and interact with the chatbot in a more efficient and intuitive manner.

### Usage & Examples

The Search component is used in various parts of the chatbot user interface where search functionality is required. It is typically used with a placeholder text, a search term, and a function to handle search term updates.

For example, the Search component might be used in a sidebar for searching through a list of chatbot conversations. The placeholder text might be 'Search conversations', the search term would be the current search term entered by the user, and the onSearch function would update the search term and perform the search when the user types in the search input field.
