## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a crucial part of the user interface, providing a visual indication of a loading state. The Spinner component is a React component that displays a spinning animation, typically used when the application is processing data or waiting for a response from an API request. The directory contains two files: `Spinner.tsx` and `index.ts`.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory is composed of two TypeScript files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. It is a React component that renders a spinner, typically used to indicate a loading state in a user interface. The Spinner component accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop determines the height and width of the spinner, defaulting to '1em' if not provided. The 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner, defaulting to an empty string if not provided. The spinner is created using SVG and has an animation applied to it to create the spinning effect.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component. It exports the default export from the 'Spinner.tsx' file, which is the main Spinner component. This structure allows for cleaner imports elsewhere in the codebase, as one can import the Spinner component directly from 'components/Spinner' instead of having to specify the 'Spinner.tsx' file.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Spinner.tsx` file. This file defines the Spinner component, which is a critical part of the user interface. The Spinner component provides a visual indication of a loading state, which is crucial for user experience. It helps users understand that the application is processing data or waiting for a response, preventing confusion or frustration.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project whenever there is a need to indicate a loading state. It can be imported directly from the 'components/Spinner' directory, thanks to the `index.ts` file.

Here is a simplified example of how the Spinner component might be used in a React component:

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate an API call
    setTimeout(() => {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }, 2000);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? <Spinner size="2em" className="text-blue-500" /> : <div>Data loaded</div>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

In this example, the Spinner component is displayed while the `isLoading` state is `true`. Once the simulated API call is complete (after 2 seconds), the `isLoading` state is set to `false`, and the Spinner component is replaced with the text "Data loaded".
