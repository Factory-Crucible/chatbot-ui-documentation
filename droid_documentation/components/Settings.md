## components/Settings Directory

The `components/Settings` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project. It houses three TypeScript React component files that manage the settings of the application. These components are responsible for handling the settings dialog, import functionality, and API key settings. They work together to provide a seamless user experience, allowing users to change the application theme, import data, and manage the API key.

### Contents

The `components/Settings` directory contains the following files:

- `SettingDialog.tsx`: This file exports a functional component that manages a settings dialog. It allows users to change the application theme and handles outside clicks to close the dialog.
- `Import.tsx`: This file provides an import functionality. It renders a file input and a button that triggers the file picker. It reads the selected file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls a function with the parsed data.
- `Key.tsx`: This file manages the API key settings. It maintains a local state for the key and a flag indicating if the key is being changed. It handles key press events, updates the key when 'Enter' is pressed, and focuses on the input field when the key is being changed. It renders either an input field for changing the key or a button to initiate the change, depending on the state.

### Key Components

The `SettingDialog.tsx`, `Import.tsx`, and `Key.tsx` files are the key components of the `components/Settings` directory. They are critical to the functionality of the chatbot-ui project, providing the settings management capabilities of the application.

- `SettingDialog.tsx` is responsible for managing the settings dialog. It uses several hooks, including 'useContext', 'useEffect', 'useReducer', and 'useRef', to manage the state and behavior of the dialog. It also uses the 'useTranslation' hook from 'next-i18next' for internationalization. The component fetches the current settings using the 'getSettings' utility function and allows the user to change the theme of the application. The new settings are saved using the 'saveSettings' utility function.
- `Import.tsx` provides the import functionality of the application. It uses the 'next-i18next' library for internationalization and the '@tabler/icons-react' library for icons. The component accepts a prop 'onImport' which is a function that takes a parameter of type 'SupportedExportFormats'. When a file is selected, it reads the file as text and parses it as JSON, then calls the 'onImport' function with the parsed data.
- `Key.tsx` manages the API key settings for the application. It maintains a local state for the API key and a boolean flag to indicate whether the key is being changed. The component handles key press events and updates the API key when the 'Enter' key is pressed. It also uses an effect to focus on the input field when the key is being changed.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `components/Settings` directory are used to manage the settings of the chatbot-ui application. They are used to handle the settings dialog, import functionality, and API key settings.

For example, the `SettingDialog.tsx` component is used to manage the settings dialog. It is used when the user wants to change the application theme. The component fetches the current settings, allows the user to change the theme, and saves the new settings.

The `Import.tsx` component is used to import data into the application. It is used when the user wants to import data from a file. The component renders a file input and a button that triggers the file picker. When a file is selected, it reads the file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls the 'onImport' function with the parsed data.

The `Key.tsx` component is used to manage the API key settings. It is used when the user wants to change the API key. The component maintains a local state for the key and a flag indicating if the key is being changed. It handles key press events, updates the key when 'Enter' is pressed, and focuses on the input field when the key is being changed.
