# `__tests__` Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the `chatbot-ui` project. It is a crucial part of the codebase, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the code. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within `utils`, there's another subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains one subdirectory:

- `utils`: This directory is a testing suite for utility functions within the application. It contains a subdirectory named `app` which houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.

## Key Components

The key component in the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file located in the `__tests__/utils/app` subdirectory. This file tests the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the exported objects align with the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one. The test checks that the updated data matches the expected structure of the current format.

## Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house all the test files and directories for the `chatbot-ui` project. The `importExports.test.ts` file, for instance, is used to test the import and export operations of the application. It verifies that the exported objects conform to the expected format for each version and that the `cleanData` function correctly updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

Here is a simplified example of how the `importExports.test.ts` file might be structured:

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  // Test cases for export format functions
});

describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {
  // Test cases for v1 format
});

describe('isExportFormatV2', () => {
  // Test cases for v2 format
});

// More test cases for other versions...

describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
  // Test cases for cleanData function
});
```

This example shows how the `importExports.test.ts` file is organized into different sections using the `describe` function. Each section contains test cases for a specific functionality, such as checking the export format or testing the `cleanData` function.
