Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the repository, its purpose, the technologies used, major components, conventions, structure, main flows, and testing principles. These docs are generated and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes by the Documentation Droid.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to create a user interface for a chatbot. This repository is a part of a larger system where it interacts with other services to provide a comprehensive chatbot solution. It is responsible for handling user interactions, managing chat conversations, and providing a seamless user experience.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies:

- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Docker**: A platform used to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers.
- **Kubernetes**: An open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components:

- **Components**: This directory houses various parts of the project, each corresponding to a specific functionality or feature of the chatbot UI.
- **Pages**: This directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests.
- **Utils**: This directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project.
- **Hooks**: This directory defines custom React hooks.
- **Services**: This directory contains services for error handling and API calls.
- **Types**: This directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants.
- **K8s**: This directory contains Kubernetes configurations.

### Conventions

The codebase follows several conventions:

- **File Naming**: Files are named according to their functionality. For example, 'chat.ts' in the 'types' directory defines structures for chat systems.
- **Directory Structure**: The directory structure is organized based on the functionality of the files. For example, all React components are located in the 'components' directory.
- **Testing**: All test files are located in the '__tests__' directory.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. Here is a high-level overview of the directory structure:

```
.
├── components
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
│   └── api
├── public
│   └── screenshots
├── services
├── styles
├── types
└── utils
    ├── app
    ├── data
    └── server
```

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around managing chat conversations, handling user interactions, and making API calls. For example, when a user sends a message, the 'Chat' component in the 'components' directory handles the user input, the 'useApiService' hook in the 'services' directory makes an API call to the OpenAI API, and the response is then displayed in the chat interface.

### System Connections

The system interacts with external services such as the OpenAI API and Google APIs. The 'useApiService' hook in the 'services' directory is responsible for making these API calls. The 'models.ts' file in the 'pages/api' directory handles requests related to OpenAI models, and the 'google.ts' file in the same directory interacts with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API to generate prompts and send responses.

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows a testing structure where all test files are located in the '__tests__' directory. The 'utils' subdirectory serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. For example, the 'importExports.test.ts' file in the 'utils/app' subdirectory validates the import and export operations of the application.
