Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the codebase and its structure, and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes by the Documentation Droid.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to provide a user interface for a chatbot application. This repository is a crucial part of the larger Factory-Crucible project, interacting with other services to provide a seamless user experience.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies. It is a Docker-based Node.js project that uses TypeScript for static typing. The frontend is built with ReactJS, and the styling is managed by Tailwind CSS. The project also uses Kubernetes for container orchestration.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different major component. The 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants.

### Conventions

The codebase follows several conventions. File naming follows the convention of using camelCase for JavaScript and TypeScript files. The project uses the '__tests__' directory for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. Some directories contain a lot of code, while others contain static assets and are rarely utilized. The structure of the codebase is as follows:

```
.
├── __tests__
├── components
├── droid_documentation
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
├── public
├── services
├── styles
├── types
└── utils
```

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the interaction between the user interface and the backend services. The 'pages' directory contains the entry points for these flows, with the 'api' subdirectory handling API requests and responses. The 'components' directory houses the React components that make up the user interface, and the 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks that encapsulate complex logic and state management, and the 'utils' directory contains utility functions that are used throughout the codebase.

For a more in-depth understanding of these flows, please refer to the following documentation files:

- [Pages Documentation](./droid_documentation/pages.md)
- [Components Documentation](./droid_documentation/components/README.md)
- [Services Documentation](./droid_documentation/services.md)
- [Hooks Documentation](./droid_documentation/hooks.md)
- [Utils Documentation](./droid_documentation/utils.md)

### System Connections

The codebase interacts with several external systems, including the OpenAI API and the Google Custom Search API. The 'pages/api' directory contains files for handling these interactions. The 'models.ts' file handles requests related to OpenAI models, and the 'google.ts' file interacts with the Google Custom Search API to generate prompts and send responses.

For more information on these interactions, please refer to the [Pages Documentation](./droid_documentation/pages.md).

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows several testing principles. The '__tests__' directory is dedicated to testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory serving as a testing suite. The 'importExports.test.ts' file validates the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version.

For more information on testing, please refer to the [Testing Documentation](./droid_documentation/__tests__.md).
