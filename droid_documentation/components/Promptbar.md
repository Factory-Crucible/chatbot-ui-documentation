## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. The 'Promptbar' is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. The directory contains TypeScript files and a subdirectory, each contributing to the overall functionality of the 'Promptbar' component.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory named `components`. The TypeScript files include `index.ts`, `PromptBar.context.tsx`, `Promptbar.tsx`, and `Promptbar.state.tsx`. The `index.ts` file serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, while `PromptBar.context.tsx` defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. The `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file, and `Promptbar.state.tsx` defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory contains related components such as `Prompts.tsx`, `PromptbarSettings.tsx`, `Prompt.tsx`, `PromptModal.tsx`, and `PromptFolders.tsx`. These components contribute to various aspects of the 'Promptbar' functionality, including rendering a list of prompts, managing prompts, rendering a modal for editing prompts, and managing folders within the 'Promptbar'.

### Key Components

The `Promptbar.tsx` file is a key component in this directory. It represents the 'Promptbar' component, a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. The file uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects, and it imports several other components and contexts to handle actions like toggling the prompt bar, creating, deleting, and updating prompts, and dropping prompts into folders.

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is another critical component. It defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts. This context is used throughout the 'Promptbar' component and its subcomponents to manage state and handle user interactions.

The `components/Promptbar/components/Prompt.tsx` file is a significant subcomponent. It exports a 'PromptComponent' that handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and manages local state for various functionalities. This component is crucial for the functionality of the 'Promptbar', as it allows users to interact with individual prompts.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to build and manage the 'Promptbar' component of the chatbot-ui project. The 'Promptbar' component is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders.

For example, the `Promptbar.tsx` file defines the 'Promptbar' component, using the 'PromptbarContext' to dispatch actions and handle updates and deletions of prompts. It also manages local state for showing a modal, deleting, renaming, and the rename value.

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is used to define the context for the 'Promptbar' component. This context includes the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts. This context is used throughout the 'Promptbar' component and its subcomponents to manage state and handle user interactions.

The `components/Promptbar/components/Prompt.tsx` file exports a 'PromptComponent' that handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts. This component is used within the 'Promptbar' component to allow users to interact with individual prompts.

The `components/Promptbar/components/PromptFolders.tsx` file exports a component that handles the display and functionality of folders within the 'Promptbar'. This includes the dropping of prompts into folders, updating the prompt's folderId when dropped. This component is used within the 'Promptbar' component to manage folders and their interactions with prompts.
