## components/Sidebar

The `components/Sidebar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It houses the TypeScript files that define the Sidebar component and its functionalities. The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The directory also includes a subdirectory, `components/Sidebar/components`, which contains additional component files for managing the sidebar.

### Contents

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point, exporting the main Sidebar component from 'Sidebar.tsx'.
- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `components/Sidebar/components`: This subdirectory contains additional component files for managing the sidebar. Notably, it includes 'OpenCloseButton.tsx', which exports two components responsible for opening and closing the sidebar.

### Key Components

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains several key components:

- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `OpenCloseButton.tsx`: This file, located in the `components/Sidebar/components` subdirectory, exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are responsible for opening and closing the sidebar.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Sidebar` directory are used to manage the sidebar of the chatbot UI. The Sidebar component, defined in `Sidebar.tsx`, is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization.

The `SidebarButton.tsx` file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. This component is used to create buttons within the sidebar.

The `OpenCloseButton.tsx` file, located in the `components/Sidebar/components` subdirectory, exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are used to open and close the sidebar. They accept two props: 'onClick', a function triggered when the button is clicked, and 'side', a string indicating the side of the screen where the sidebar is located.

For example, the `SidebarButton.tsx` component could be used as follows:

```typescript
<SidebarButton text="Home" icon={<HomeIcon />} onClick={handleHomeClick} />
```

This would create a button in the sidebar with the label "Home", an icon represented by `<HomeIcon />`, and a click handler function `handleHomeClick`.

Please note that the above example is a simplified representation and the actual usage may vary based on the context and requirements of the application.
