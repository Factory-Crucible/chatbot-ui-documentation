## components/Sidebar

The `components/Sidebar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It houses the TypeScript files that define the Sidebar component and its functionalities. The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The Sidebar component is not just a static element but a dynamic part of the user interface that can open and close, change its appearance based on the screen size, and handle various actions such as creating items and folders, and handling search terms.

### Contents

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: Serves as an entry point, exporting the main Sidebar component from 'Sidebar.tsx'.
- `Sidebar.tsx`: Defines the Sidebar component, a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: Defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `components/Sidebar/components`: A subdirectory that contains additional component files for managing the sidebar.

### Key Components

The key components in the `components/Sidebar` directory are the `Sidebar.tsx` and `SidebarButton.tsx` files.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `components/Sidebar` directory are used to create the Sidebar component of the chatbot UI. The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. 

The `Sidebar.tsx` file defines the Sidebar component. It takes a variety of props including flags for whether it's open, the side it should appear on, and handlers for various actions such as creating items and folders, and handling search terms. It also accepts components to render items, folders, and a footer. The Sidebar component itself is a functional component that conditionally renders different layouts based on whether it's open or not. It also handles drag and drop events.

The `SidebarButton.tsx` file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. The SidebarButton component is used in the Sidebar component to provide interactive elements for the user.

The `components/Sidebar/components` subdirectory contains additional component files for managing the sidebar. Notably, it includes 'OpenCloseButton.tsx', which exports two components responsible for opening and closing the sidebar. These components change appearance based on the screen size.
