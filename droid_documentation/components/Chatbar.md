## components/Chatbar

The `components/Chatbar` directory is a part of the chatbot UI project. It contains three TypeScript files and a subdirectory. The files define the state, context, and the main React component for the chatbar. The subdirectory contains additional components used in the chatbar.

### Contents

The directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

- `Chatbar.state.tsx`: Defines the initial state for the Chatbar component.
- `Chatbar.tsx`: A React component representing the chat bar.
- `Chatbar.context.tsx`: Defines the context for the Chatbar component.
- `components`: A subdirectory containing additional components used in the chatbar.

### Key Components

- `Chatbar.tsx`: This is the main component of the chatbar. It defines handlers for various actions like changing API keys and managing conversations. It also wraps a 'Sidebar' component, passing down various props and handlers.
- `Chatbar.state.tsx`: This file sets the initial state for the Chatbar component, including a search term and a list of filtered conversations.
- `Chatbar.context.tsx`: This file defines the context for the Chatbar component, including the state, dispatch function, and several handler functions.

### Usage & Examples

The files in this directory are used to manage the chatbar component of the chatbot UI. The `Chatbar.tsx` file is the main component file, which uses the state and context defined in `Chatbar.state.tsx` and `Chatbar.context.tsx` respectively. The `components` subdirectory contains additional components used in the chatbar, such as settings, conversations, chat folders, and plugin keys.
