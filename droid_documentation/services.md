# Services Directory

The `services` directory plays a crucial role in the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses two TypeScript files, `errorService.ts` and `useApiService.ts`, which define custom React hooks that provide essential functionalities to the application. These hooks are responsible for handling errors and making API calls, respectively. The encapsulation of these functionalities within the `services` directory ensures a clean and modular architecture, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Contents

The `services` directory contains the following TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named `useErrorService` that provides localized error messages. It returns a function `getModelsError` that takes an error object and returns an `ErrorMessage` object with a title, status code, and list of messages.

- `useApiService.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useApiService` that uses `useFetch` to make API calls. It provides a function `getModels` that makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint. The function accepts an object of type `GetModelsRequestProps` and an optional `AbortSignal`.

## Key Components

The `services` directory contains two key TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: The `useErrorService` hook defined in this file is crucial for providing localized error messages. It uses the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next` to translate error messages, ensuring a user-friendly experience. The `getModelsError` function it returns takes an error object and returns an `ErrorMessage` object, which includes a title, status code, and list of messages. This function is vital for handling errors in the application.

- `useApiService.ts`: The `useApiService` hook defined in this file is essential for making API calls within the application. It uses the `useFetch` hook to perform these operations. The `getModels` function it provides makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint, accepting an object of type `GetModelsRequestProps` and an optional `AbortSignal`. This function is key to fetching data from the API.

## Usage & Examples

The files in the `services` directory are used throughout the codebase to handle errors and make API calls.

- `errorService.ts`: The `useErrorService` hook is used in components that need to handle errors. For example, a component that fetches data from an API would use this hook to handle any errors that occur during the fetch operation. The `getModelsError` function would be used to get an `ErrorMessage` object for the error, which could then be displayed to the user.

- `useApiService.ts`: The `useApiService` hook is used in components that need to make API calls. For example, a component that needs to fetch data from the `/api/models` endpoint would use the `getModels` function. The function would be called with an object of type `GetModelsRequestProps` and an optional `AbortSignal`, and the result of the fetch operation would be used in the component.

Please note that the code snippets provided in the `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE` are not representative of typical usage patterns. They are provided to give an idea of the structure and functionality of the code, but the actual usage of these hooks and functions would depend on the specific requirements of the components in which they are used.
