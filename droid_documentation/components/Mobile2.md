## components/Mobile2

The `components/Mobile2` directory is dedicated to the `Mobile2` module of the chatbot UI application. It contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional React component named `Navbar`. This component is a key part of the mobile user interface, rendering a navigation bar that displays the name of the currently selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' icon. The `Navbar` component is designed to be interactive, triggering a function when the 'IconPlus' icon is clicked.

### Contents

The `components/Mobile2` directory contains one file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines the `Navbar` component. It is a functional React component that accepts two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`. The `selectedConversation` prop is of type `Conversation`, representing the currently selected conversation. The `onNewConversation` prop is a function that is triggered when the 'IconPlus' icon in the navigation bar is clicked.

### Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the `Navbar` component, which is a crucial part of the mobile user interface. The `Navbar` component displays the name of the currently selected conversation and provides an interactive 'IconPlus' icon that triggers a function when clicked.

### Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the `Mobile2` module to render a navigation bar in the mobile user interface. It accepts two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`. The `selectedConversation` prop is used to display the name of the currently selected conversation in the navigation bar. The `onNewConversation` prop is a function that is triggered when the user clicks on the 'IconPlus' icon in the navigation bar.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is the currently selected conversation, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that is triggered when the 'IconPlus' icon is clicked. This function could, for example, open a dialog for creating a new conversation.
