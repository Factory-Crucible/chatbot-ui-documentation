## `components/Buttons` Directory

The `components/Buttons` directory is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the chatbot user interface. This specific directory, `components/Buttons`, is dedicated to the implementation of button components used across the chatbot UI. The directory contains a subdirectory named `SidebarActionButton`, which defines a specific type of button used in the sidebar of the chatbot UI. The `SidebarActionButton` component is designed with specific styling and functionality to fit its role in the user interface.

### Contents

The `components/Buttons` directory contains a single subdirectory: `SidebarActionButton`. This subdirectory houses two TypeScript files: `index.ts` and `SidebarActionButton.tsx`.

- `SidebarActionButton`: This subdirectory contains the implementation of the `SidebarActionButton` component, a button with specific styling and functionality used in the sidebar of the chatbot UI.

- `index.ts`: This file is a module export file that simplifies import paths by re-exporting the default export from `SidebarActionButton.tsx`.

- `SidebarActionButton.tsx`: This file defines the `SidebarActionButton` component, a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`.

### Key Components

The key component within this directory is the `SidebarActionButton` component, defined in the `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file. This component is a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`. The `handleClick` prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the `children` prop renders any child elements within the button. The button's style includes a minimum width of 20px, padding of 1, and different text colors for normal and hover states.

### Usage & Examples

The `SidebarActionButton` component is used within the chatbot UI to provide a button with specific styling and functionality in the sidebar. The `handleClick` prop allows the parent component to define what happens when the button is clicked, and the `children` prop allows the parent component to render any child elements within the button.

For example, a `SidebarActionButton` might be used in the sidebar to toggle a settings menu. The `handleClick` prop would be a function that toggles the visibility of the settings menu, and the `children` prop might be an icon representing the settings menu.

```typescript
<SidebarActionButton handleClick={toggleSettingsMenu}>
  <SettingsIcon />
</SidebarActionButton>
```

In this example, clicking the `SidebarActionButton` would call the `toggleSettingsMenu` function, toggling the visibility of the settings menu. The `SettingsIcon` component would be rendered within the button.
