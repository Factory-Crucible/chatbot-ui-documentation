## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The Spinner component is a crucial part of the user experience, providing feedback to the user when an operation is in progress and preventing confusion or frustration. The directory contains two TypeScript files that define and export the Spinner component.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two files:

- `index.ts`: This TypeScript file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component. It exports the default export from the `Spinner.tsx` file, simplifying imports elsewhere in the project.
- `Spinner.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines the Spinner component. The component displays a spinning animation and accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop controls the dimensions of the spinner, and the 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes.

The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Spinner.tsx` file. This file defines the Spinner component, which is a critical part of the user interface. The Spinner component provides visual feedback to the user when an operation is in progress, improving the user experience. The component is created using SVG and includes an animation for the spinning effect. It accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop controls the dimensions of the spinner, and the 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes.

The `index.ts` file is also important as it simplifies the import process of the Spinner component in other parts of the codebase. By exporting the default export from the `Spinner.tsx` file, the Spinner component can be imported directly from 'components/Spinner' without specifying the 'Spinner.tsx' file.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate a loading state. Whenever an operation is in progress, such as fetching data from an API or loading a new page, the Spinner component is displayed to the user. This provides visual feedback and improves the user experience.

The Spinner component can be used in other components or pages like so:

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

// In a component or page
return (
  <div>
    <Spinner size="2em" className="my-spinner" />
  </div>
);
```

In this example, the Spinner component is imported from 'components/Spinner' and used in a div. The 'size' prop is set to '2em', making the spinner twice the size of the default, and the 'className' prop is set to 'my-spinner', allowing for additional styling.
