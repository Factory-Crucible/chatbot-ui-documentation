## components/Folder

The `components/Folder` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project. It houses the `Folder` React component, which is responsible for representing a folder in a file system within the user interface. This component is designed to be interactive, allowing users to open and close the folder, rename it, and even delete it. The `Folder` component also supports drag and drop functionality, providing a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. The `Folder` component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project, making it a key part of the user interface.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a TypeScript file that exports a single React component named `Folder`. The `Folder` component represents a folder in a file system and includes several interactive features. It accepts several props, maintains its own state, and renders a button and an input field. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The component uses icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package.
- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from the `components/Folder` directory. It exports the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file, allowing other files to import the `Folder` component from `index.ts` instead of `Folder.tsx`.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It exports the `Folder` React component, which is a critical part of the chatbot-ui project's user interface. The `Folder` component is responsible for representing a folder in a file system, providing an interactive and intuitive user experience. It accepts several props, maintains its own state, and includes handlers for various user interactions. The `Folder` component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project, making it a key part of the user interface.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to represent a folder in a file system. It is a versatile component that can be used in various parts of the user interface, providing an interactive and intuitive user experience.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Folder` component might be used:

```typescript
import Folder from '../components/Folder';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const handleDrop = (e, folder) => {
    // Handle the drop event
  };

  return (
    <Folder
      currentFolder={myFolder}
      searchTerm={mySearchTerm}
      handleDrop={handleDrop}
      folderComponent={myFolderComponent}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example, the `Folder` component is imported from `index.ts` in the `components/Folder` directory. It is then used in `MyComponent`, with several props being passed in. The `handleDrop` function is defined within `MyComponent` and passed as a prop to the `Folder` component, allowing `MyComponent` to handle drop events.
