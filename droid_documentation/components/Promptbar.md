## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. The 'Promptbar' is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. This directory contains TypeScript files that define the structure, state, and context of the 'Promptbar' component. It also includes a subdirectory named 'components' that houses related components such as 'Prompts', 'PromptbarSettings', 'Prompt', 'PromptModal', and 'PromptFolders'.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory is organized into five TypeScript files and one subdirectory. The TypeScript files include:

- `index.ts`: Serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the default export from the 'Promptbar.tsx' file.
- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: Defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: The main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: Defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.

The subdirectory `components/Promptbar/components` contains related components:

- `Prompts.tsx`: Renders a list of prompts.
- `PromptbarSettings.tsx`: Handles 'Promptbar' settings.
- `Prompt.tsx`: Manages prompts.
- `PromptModal.tsx`: Renders a modal for editing prompts.
- `PromptFolders.tsx`: Manages folders within the 'Promptbar'.

### Key Components

The `Promptbar.tsx` file is a key component in this directory. It represents the 'Promptbar' sidebar in the user interface and contains functions for managing prompts and folders. It uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects, and it imports several other components such as 'PromptFolders', 'PromptbarSettings', and 'Prompts'. It also imports a context 'HomeContext' and a state 'Promptbar.state'.

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is another critical component. It defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts. The context is then exported for use in other parts of the application.

The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file outlines the structure of the initial state for the 'Promptbar' component, including a 'searchTerm' of type string and 'filteredPrompts' which is an array of 'Prompt' objects.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to manage the 'Promptbar' feature of the chatbot-ui application. The 'Promptbar' is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders.

For instance, the `Promptbar.tsx` file exports a 'Promptbar' component that uses the 'PromptbarContext' to dispatch actions and handle updates and deletions of prompts. It also manages local state for showing a modal, deleting, renaming, and the rename value.

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file defines a 'PromptbarContext' that is used in other parts of the application. It outlines the shape of the context, including the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts.

The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component. This includes a 'searchTerm' of type string and 'filteredPrompts' which is an array of 'Prompt' objects.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory contains several related components. For example, the 'Prompts.tsx' component renders a list of prompts, the 'Prompt.tsx' component handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and the 'PromptFolders.tsx' component handles the display and functionality of folders within the 'Promptbar'.
