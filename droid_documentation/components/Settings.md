## components/Settings Directory

The `components/Settings` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the hub for managing the application's settings. This directory contains three TypeScript React component files: `SettingDialog.tsx`, `Import.tsx`, and `Key.tsx`. These components are responsible for managing a settings dialog, providing import functionality, and handling API key settings respectively. They work together to provide a seamless user experience, allowing users to customize the application to their preferences, import data, and manage their API keys.

### Contents

The `components/Settings` directory contains three files:

- `SettingDialog.tsx`: This file exports a functional component that manages a settings dialog. The dialog allows users to change the application theme and handles outside clicks to close the dialog.
- `Import.tsx`: This file provides an import functionality, rendering a file input and a button that triggers the file picker. It reads the selected file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls a function with the parsed data.
- `Key.tsx`: This file manages the API key settings, maintaining a local state for the key and a flag indicating if the key is being changed. It handles key press events, updates the key when 'Enter' is pressed, and focuses on the input field when the key is being changed. It renders either an input field for changing the key or a button to initiate the change, depending on the state.

### Key Components

The `SettingDialog.tsx`, `Import.tsx`, and `Key.tsx` files are the key components of the `components/Settings` directory. 

- `SettingDialog.tsx` is critical as it provides the interface for users to customize the application's theme. It fetches the current settings using the `getSettings` utility function and saves the new settings using the `saveSettings` utility function. 
- `Import.tsx` is essential as it provides the functionality to import data into the application. It reads the selected file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls a function with the parsed data.
- `Key.tsx` is vital as it manages the API key settings for the application. It maintains a local state for the API key and a boolean flag to indicate whether the key is being changed. It handles key press events and updates the API key when the 'Enter' key is pressed.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `components/Settings` directory are used to manage the application's settings. 

- `SettingDialog.tsx` is used to manage a settings dialog. It is used when the user wants to change the application theme. The `open` prop determines whether the dialog is visible or not, and `onClose` is a function that is called when the dialog needs to be closed.
- `Import.tsx` is used to provide an import functionality for the application. It accepts a prop 'onImport' which is a function that takes a parameter of type 'SupportedExportFormats'. When a file is selected, it reads the file as text and parses it as JSON, then calls the 'onImport' function with the parsed data.
- `Key.tsx` is used to manage the API key settings for the application. It takes in two props: 'apiKey' and 'onApiKeyChange'. It maintains a local state for the API key and a boolean flag to indicate whether the key is being changed. The component handles key press events and updates the API key when the 'Enter' key is pressed.
