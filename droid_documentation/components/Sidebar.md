## components/Sidebar

The `components/Sidebar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It houses the TypeScript files that define the Sidebar component and its functionalities. The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The Sidebar component is a key part of the user interface, providing a navigational structure for the application.

### Contents

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Sidebar component, exporting the main Sidebar component from 'Sidebar.tsx'.
- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `components/Sidebar/components`: This subdirectory contains additional component files for managing the sidebar. Notably, it includes 'OpenCloseButton.tsx', which exports two components responsible for opening and closing the sidebar.

### Key Components

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains several key components:

- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. This component is used extensively within the Sidebar component to create interactive elements.
- `components/Sidebar/components/OpenCloseButton.tsx`: This file exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are responsible for opening and closing the sidebar, respectively. They accept two props: 'onClick', a function triggered when the button is clicked, and 'side', a string indicating the side of the screen where the sidebar is located.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Sidebar` directory are used to construct the Sidebar component of the chatbot UI. The Sidebar component is a key part of the user interface, providing a navigational structure for the application.

For example, the `Sidebar.tsx` file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. This component is used throughout the application to provide a consistent and interactive sidebar for navigation.

The `SidebarButton.tsx` file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. This component is used extensively within the Sidebar component to create interactive elements.

The `components/Sidebar/components/OpenCloseButton.tsx` file exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are responsible for opening and closing the sidebar, respectively. They accept two props: 'onClick', a function triggered when the button is clicked, and 'side', a string indicating the side of the screen where the sidebar is located. These components are used to provide interactive elements that allow the user to open and close the sidebar.
