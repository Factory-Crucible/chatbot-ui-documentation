Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. The documentation is generated and maintained by the Documentation Droid, ensuring it stays up-to-date as the codebase evolves.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to provide a user interface for a chatbot application. This repository is a crucial part of a larger system, interacting with other services to provide a seamless user experience.

### Technologies Used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies. It is a Docker-based Node.js project that uses TypeScript for static typing. The frontend is built with ReactJS, and the styling is managed by Tailwind CSS. The project also uses Kubernetes for container orchestration.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, while the 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The '__tests__' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

### Conventions

The codebase follows certain conventions for better understanding. File naming follows a consistent pattern, with '.ts' and '.tsx' extensions for TypeScript and TypeScript React files respectively. The 'index.ts' files serve as entry points for their respective directories, exporting the main components or functions.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into directories, each serving a specific purpose. Here is a high-level overview of the directory structure:

```
.
├── __tests__
├── components
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
├── public
├── services
├── styles
├── types
└── utils
```

For a more detailed overview of each directory, please refer to the respective markdown files in the documentation directory.

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the user interface of the chatbot application. The 'pages' directory contains the main entry point for the application, with the 'index.tsx' file rendering the home page. The 'api' subdirectory within 'pages' handles API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, each contributing to the overall user interface.

### System Connections

The system interacts with external services like OpenAI and Google APIs. The 'api' subdirectory within 'pages' handles these interactions. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'utils' directory provides utility functions for server-side operations, including making POST requests to the OpenAI API.

## Testing Principles

The '__tests__' directory is dedicated to testing in the project. It contains a subdirectory named 'utils', which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. The 'importExports.test.ts' file validates the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version.
