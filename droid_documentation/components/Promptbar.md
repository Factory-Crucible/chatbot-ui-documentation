## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It is a part of the React application and contains TypeScript files and a subdirectory. The directory is responsible for managing the 'Promptbar' component, which represents a sidebar in the user interface of the application. The 'Promptbar' component is responsible for managing prompts and folders, providing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the chatbot. The directory contains several files that define the 'Promptbar' component, its context, state, and related subcomponents. The subdirectory 'components/Promptbar/components' contains related components that are used within the 'Promptbar' component.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains five TypeScript files and one subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the component for use in other parts of the application.
- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.
- `components/Promptbar/components`: This subdirectory contains related components used within the 'Promptbar' component.

### Key Components

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several key components that contribute to the functionality of the 'Promptbar' component:

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This file is crucial as it defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component. The context includes the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts. This context is used across the 'Promptbar' component and its subcomponents to manage state and handle user interactions.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file for the 'Promptbar'. It represents a sidebar in the UI and contains functions for managing prompts and folders. It uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects, making it a central part of the 'Promptbar' functionality.
- `components/Promptbar/components`: This subdirectory contains several related components that are used within the 'Promptbar' component. These components handle various aspects of the 'Promptbar' functionality, such as rendering a list of prompts, managing folders within the 'Promptbar', and rendering a modal for editing prompts.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to manage the 'Promptbar' component within the application. The 'Promptbar' component is a sidebar in the UI that allows users to interact with prompts and folders.

For example, the `Promptbar.tsx` file defines the 'Promptbar' component. It uses the 'PromptbarContext' to manage state and handle user interactions with prompts and folders. It also imports several other components such as 'PromptFolders', 'PromptbarSettings', and 'Prompts' to handle various aspects of the 'Promptbar' functionality.

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component. This context includes the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts. This context is used across the 'Promptbar' component and its subcomponents to manage state and handle user interactions.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory contains several related components that are used within the 'Promptbar' component. These components handle various aspects of the 'Promptbar' functionality, such as rendering a list of prompts, managing folders within the 'Promptbar', and rendering a modal for editing prompts.
