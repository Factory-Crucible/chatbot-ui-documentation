## components/Mobile Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a crucial part of the project's responsive design strategy, ensuring that the chatbot interface is accessible and user-friendly across a variety of devices. The directory is currently composed of a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component for the mobile application's navigation bar. This component, named `Navbar`, is specifically designed to facilitate user interaction within the chat application on mobile devices.

### Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is a lean structure, containing only one file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines the `Navbar` functional component. The `Navbar` component is designed for the mobile application's navigation bar, providing a user-friendly interface for chat interactions on mobile devices.

### Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component within the `components/Mobile` directory. It defines the `Navbar` functional component, which is a critical part of the mobile user interface. The `Navbar` component is designed to display the currently active chat conversation and provide an interface for initiating new conversations. It accepts two props:

- `selectedConversation`: An object of type `Conversation` representing the currently active chat.
- `onNewConversation`: A function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated.

The `Navbar` component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the `onNewConversation` function, allowing users to easily start new conversations from the mobile interface.

### Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a critical part of the mobile interface, providing a user-friendly navigation bar for chat interactions.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used within the application:

```typescript
import { Navbar } from './components/Mobile/Navbar';

function MobileChatInterface() {
  const [selectedConversation, setSelectedConversation] = useState<Conversation>(null);

  const handleNewConversation = () => {
    // Logic to start a new conversation
  };

  return (
    <Navbar
      selectedConversation={selectedConversation}
      onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, the `Navbar` component is imported from the `components/Mobile/Navbar` file and used within the `MobileChatInterface` component. The `selectedConversation` state is managed within the `MobileChatInterface` component, and the `handleNewConversation` function is defined to handle the logic for starting a new conversation. These are then passed as props to the `Navbar` component.
