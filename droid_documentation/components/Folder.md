## components/Folder

The `components/Folder` directory is dedicated to the representation and functionality of a folder within the file system of the chatbot UI. It contains two main files: `Folder.tsx` and `index.ts`. The `Folder.tsx` file is a React component that encapsulates the behavior and rendering of a folder, including renaming, deleting, and handling drag and drop events. The `index.ts` file simplifies the import process from this directory by exporting the default export from `Folder.tsx`.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains the following files:

- `Folder.tsx`: A React component that represents a folder in the file system. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether the folder is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.
- `index.ts`: A TypeScript file that exports the default export from `Folder.tsx`, simplifying imports from this directory.

### Key Components

- `Folder.tsx`: This file is the heart of the `components/Folder` directory. It defines the `Folder` component, which encapsulates the behavior and rendering of a folder in the file system. The `Folder` component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It maintains state and renders a button and an input field, and it includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used throughout the codebase wherever a folder in the file system needs to be represented. It is typically used in conjunction with other components, such as in a file tree or a directory listing.

For example, the `Folder` component might be used in a file tree component like this:

```typescript
<Folder
  currentFolder={currentFolder}
  searchTerm={searchTerm}
  handleDrop={handleDrop}
  folderComponent={folderComponent}
/>
```

In this example, `currentFolder` is the folder being represented, `searchTerm` is a string used to filter the contents of the folder, `handleDrop` is a function that handles drag and drop events, and `folderComponent` is a list of components representing the contents of the folder.
