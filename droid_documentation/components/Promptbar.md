## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the home for the `Promptbar` component and its related subcomponents. The `Promptbar` component is a sidebar in the user interface of the chatbot, providing functionalities for managing prompts and folders. The directory contains TypeScript files that define the `Promptbar` component, its context, initial state, and interface. It also includes a subdirectory `components/Promptbar/components` that houses related components such as `Prompts`, `PromptbarSettings`, `Prompt`, `PromptModal`, and `PromptFolders`.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory is structured into several TypeScript files and a subdirectory:

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This file defines the context for the `Promptbar` component, including state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file defines the initial state and interface for the `Promptbar` component.
- `index.ts`: This is the entry point, exporting the `Promptbar` component.
- `components/Promptbar/components`: This subdirectory contains related components.

### Key Components

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several key files and components:

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This context file is crucial as it provides the state and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts, which are central to the functionality of the `Promptbar` component.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI. It is responsible for managing prompts and folders, making it a key part of the chatbot's user interface.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file defines the initial state and interface for the `Promptbar` component, providing a clear structure for the component's state.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to build and manage the `Promptbar` component within the chatbot-ui project. 

For instance, the `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is used to provide a context for the `Promptbar` component. This context includes the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts. 

The `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI. It uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects. It also imports several other components such as `PromptFolders`, `PromptbarSettings`, and `Prompts`.

The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file defines the initial state and interface for the `Promptbar` component. This includes a `searchTerm` of type string and `filteredPrompts` which is an array of `Prompt` objects.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory contains several TypeScript React components related to the `Promptbar` feature of the application. For example, `Prompts.tsx` exports a `Prompts` component that renders a list of prompts. `Prompt.tsx` exports a `PromptComponent` that handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and manages local state for various functionalities.
