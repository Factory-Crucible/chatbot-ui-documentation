## components/Folder

The `components/Folder` directory is a part of the chatbot-ui project's component architecture, specifically designed to represent a folder in a file system within the user interface. This directory contains two main files: `Folder.tsx` and `index.ts`. The `Folder.tsx` file is a React component that encapsulates the functionality and presentation of a folder in the file system. It is responsible for rendering a button and an input field, handling renaming and deleting of the folder, and managing drag and drop events. The `index.ts` file simplifies the import process from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains the following files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. This component represents a folder in a file system and includes several functionalities such as renaming and deleting the folder, and handling drag and drop events. The component uses several icons from the `@tabler/icons-react` package.
- `index.ts`: This file simplifies the import process from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects to simplify imports from a directory.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is a critical component in the `components/Folder` directory. It exports a `Folder` component that encapsulates the functionality and presentation of a folder in the file system. The component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component renders a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the chatbot-ui project to represent a folder in a file system. It is a part of the user interface and is responsible for rendering a button and an input field, handling renaming and deleting of the folder, and managing drag and drop events.

For example, the `Folder` component might be used in a file explorer feature of the chatbot-ui project. The component would be responsible for rendering each folder in the file explorer, handling user interactions such as renaming and deleting folders, and managing drag and drop events for moving files between folders.

The `Folder` component is typically used with several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. The component maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed.

```typescript
const FolderComponent = ({
  currentFolder,
  searchTerm,
  handleDrop,
  folderComponent,
}) => <Folder currentFolder={currentFolder} searchTerm={searchTerm} handleDrop={handleDrop} folderComponent={folderComponent} />;
```

Please note that this is a simplified example and the actual usage of the `Folder` component may vary depending on the context and requirements of the chatbot-ui project.
