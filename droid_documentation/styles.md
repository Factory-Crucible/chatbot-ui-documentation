## Styles Directory

The `styles` directory in the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase is dedicated to managing the global styles for the project. It is a crucial part of the codebase as it defines the visual aesthetics of the chatbot user interface. The directory contains a single file, `globals.css`, which holds the global styles for the project. This file is responsible for setting the overall look and feel of the application, including the background color, scrollbar styles, and responsive design elements.

### Contents

The `styles` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing only one file:

- `globals.css`: This is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file that contains global styles for the project. It includes the import of base, components, and utilities from Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The file also contains custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, including its track, thumb, and corner, with different styles for hover states. It sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade. Additionally, it contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Lastly, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Key Components

The key component in the `styles` directory is the `globals.css` file. This file is critical to the project as it defines the global styles that are applied throughout the application. It is responsible for the overall visual aesthetics of the chatbot user interface, including the background color, scrollbar styles, and responsive design elements.

The `globals.css` file is also notable for its use of the Tailwind CSS framework. This utility-first CSS framework provides a set of pre-designed classes that can be composed to build complex designs. The `globals.css` file imports the base, components, and utilities from Tailwind CSS, providing a solid foundation for the project's styles.

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file in the `styles` directory is used to define the global styles for the chatbot user interface. These styles are applied throughout the application, ensuring a consistent look and feel.

For example, the file sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade. This sets the overall theme for the application, providing a dark mode user interface.

The file also contains custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. These styles are applied to the track, thumb, and corner of the scrollbar, with different styles for hover states. This ensures that the scrollbar matches the overall aesthetic of the application.

Additionally, the file contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px. This adjusts the width of 'pre' elements under this condition, ensuring that the application is responsive and looks good on smaller screens.

Lastly, the file removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'. This ensures that code blocks are displayed correctly, without any unnecessary padding.
