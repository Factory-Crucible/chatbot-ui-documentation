## components/Folder Directory

The `components/Folder` directory is a part of the `chatbot-ui` project's codebase that is responsible for the representation and manipulation of a folder in a file system within the user interface. This directory contains a React component, `Folder.tsx`, which is designed to handle the visual representation of a folder, as well as the interactions associated with it, such as renaming, deleting, and drag and drop events. The `Folder` component is a crucial part of the project's file system management, providing users with an intuitive and interactive way to manage their folders.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory consists of two TypeScript files:

1. `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. The `Folder` component represents a folder in a file system and includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

2. `index.ts`: This file simplifies imports from the `components/Folder` directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is a critical component in this directory. It exports a `Folder` component that represents a folder in a file system. The `Folder` component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component renders a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

The `index.ts` file, while not as complex as the `Folder.tsx` file, plays a crucial role in simplifying the import process from this directory. By exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file, it allows other files to import from `index.ts`, which will automatically forward the import to `Folder.tsx`.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the `chatbot-ui` project to represent and manage folders in a file system. It is used wherever a folder needs to be displayed or manipulated, providing a consistent and interactive interface for users.

For example, when a user navigates to a directory in the chatbot UI, the `Folder` component would be used to represent each folder in that directory. The user could then interact with the `Folder` component to open or close the folder, rename the folder, or delete the folder. The drag and drop functionality provided by the `Folder` component also allows the user to easily move folders around within the file system.

The `Folder` component is typically used with several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. The current folder and search term are used to control the display and functionality of the `Folder` component, while the drop handler and list of folder components are used to manage drag and drop events.
