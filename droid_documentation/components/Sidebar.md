## components/Sidebar

The `components/Sidebar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It houses the TypeScript files that define the Sidebar component and its functionalities. The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The Sidebar component is a key part of the user interface, providing a navigational structure for the application.

### Contents

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Sidebar component, exporting the main Sidebar component from 'Sidebar.tsx'.
- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `components/Sidebar/components`: This subdirectory contains additional component files for managing the sidebar. Notably, it includes 'OpenCloseButton.tsx', which exports two components responsible for opening and closing the sidebar.

### Key Components

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains several key components:

- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. This component is used to create buttons in the sidebar, providing a consistent look and feel across the application.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders in the `components/Sidebar` directory are used to create and manage the sidebar in the chatbot UI. The Sidebar component is used in various parts of the application to provide a navigational structure. The SidebarButton component is used to create buttons in the sidebar, while the 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton' components are used to manage the visibility of the sidebar.

For example, the Sidebar component might be used in the main application component to provide a navigational structure. The SidebarButton component might be used to create buttons for navigating to different parts of the application, while the 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton' components might be used to allow the user to open and close the sidebar.

```typescript
import Sidebar from 'components/Sidebar';

<Sidebar
  isOpen={isOpen}
  addItemButtonTitle="Add Item"
  side="left"
  items={items}
  itemComponent={<ItemComponent />}
  folderComponent={<FolderComponent />}
  footerComponent={<FooterComponent />}
  searchTerm={searchTerm}
  handleSearchTerm={handleSearchTerm}
  toggleOpen={toggleOpen}
  handleCreateItem={handleCreateItem}
  handleCreateFolder={handleCreateFolder}
  handleDrop={handleDrop}
/>
```

In this example, the Sidebar component is imported from 'components/Sidebar' and used in the application. The component is passed various props, including flags for whether it's open, the side it should appear on, and handlers for various actions such as creating items and folders, and handling search terms. It also accepts components to render items, folders, and a footer.
