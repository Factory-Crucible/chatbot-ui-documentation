## components/Search

The `components/Search` directory is home to the `Search` component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a functional React component written in TypeScript, designed to handle user search input within the chatbot interface. It provides an input field for users to enter their search terms and an 'X' icon to clear the input field. The component is designed to be reusable and can be customized with different placeholders and search terms.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is the main file of the directory, containing the `Search` component. It exports a functional component that accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' represents the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input when clicked.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the `Search` directory, exporting the default from `Search.tsx`. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Search` component, defined in the `Search.tsx` file. This component is a functional React component that provides a search input field and a clear button for the chatbot interface. It is designed to be reusable and customizable, accepting props for the placeholder text, the current search term, and a function to update the search term.

### Usage & Examples

The `Search` component is used within the chatbot interface to provide a search functionality. It is a reusable component that can be customized with different placeholders and search terms.

For example, it can be used as follows:

```jsx
<Search placeholder="Search..." searchTerm={currentSearchTerm} onSearch={updateSearchTerm} />
```

In this example, `currentSearchTerm` is a state variable representing the current search term, and `updateSearchTerm` is a function that updates this state variable. The `placeholder` prop is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty.
