## components/Search Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a part of the `chatbot-ui` project's component architecture, specifically designed to handle the search functionality within the user interface. It encapsulates the logic and rendering of the search input field, providing a reusable and self-contained module for search operations. The directory contains two main files: `Search.tsx` and `index.ts`. The `Search.tsx` file is a TypeScript React component that exports a functional component named 'Search'. This component is responsible for rendering the search input field and handling user interactions with it. The `index.ts` file serves as the public interface for the directory, exporting the default from 'Search.tsx'.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory is composed of two TypeScript files:

- `Search.tsx`: This file is a TypeScript React component that exports a functional component named 'Search'. The 'Search' component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' represents the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input when clicked.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the directory, exporting the default from 'Search.tsx'. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the 'Search' component defined in the `Search.tsx` file. This component is a functional React component that encapsulates the search functionality within the user interface. It accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch', which control the display and behavior of the search input field. The 'Search' component is a critical part of the user interface, enabling users to search through the chatbot's content and navigate the application more efficiently.

### Usage & Examples

The 'Search' component is used within the user interface to provide a search input field. It is a reusable component that can be included in any part of the application that requires search functionality. The component is used by passing the required props to it. For example, it could be used as follows:

```tsx
<Search
  placeholder="Search..."
  searchTerm={currentSearchTerm}
  onSearch={updateSearchTerm}
/>
```

In this example, `currentSearchTerm` is a state variable that holds the current search term, and `updateSearchTerm` is a function that updates this state variable. The 'Search' component displays the current search term in the input field and calls the `updateSearchTerm` function when the user changes the input field's value or clicks the 'X' icon to clear the search input.
