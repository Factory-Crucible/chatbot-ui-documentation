The `components/Chat` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the hub for the chat functionality of the application. This directory houses a collection of React components that together form the chat interface of the application. Each component in this directory is responsible for a specific aspect of the chat interface, ranging from the chat input and message display to the selection of AI models and plugins, the adjustment of response randomness, and the handling of system prompts and variables. These components work together to provide a seamless and efficient chat experience for the users.

### Contents

The `components/Chat` directory contains a total of 13 TypeScript files, each representing a unique React component. These components are:

1. `Regenerate.tsx`: Provides a user interface for regenerating responses when an error occurs.
2. `PluginSelect.tsx`: A dropdown for plugin selection.
3. `Temperature.tsx`: A slider for adjusting the chatbot's response randomness.

### Key Components

Several components in the `components/Chat` directory play a critical role in the chat functionality of the application:

- `Chat.tsx`: This component is the heart of the chat interface. It handles the sending of messages, updating of conversations, and handling of responses. It also manages the scrolling of the chat interface and the display of the chat input and messages.

- `ChatInput.tsx`: This component provides the input functionality for the chat interface. It handles the sending of messages, stopping of the conversation, and the display of the prompt list and variable modal.

- `ChatMessage.tsx`: This component represents a single chat message in the chat interface. It provides functionalities to edit, delete, and copy a chat message. It also handles the display of the message based on the role of the sender (user or assistant).

- `SystemPrompt.tsx`: This component handles the system prompts in a chat conversation. It manages the current value of the prompt, the active prompt index, the visibility of the prompt list, the prompt input value, and the display of a modal for variables.

### Usage & Examples

The components in the `components/Chat` directory are used throughout the chatbot-ui project to provide the chat functionality. They are imported and used in various parts of the application, such as the home page and the chat page.

For example, the `Chat.tsx` component is used in the chat page to provide the main chat interface. It is used like this:

```tsx
<Chat stopConversationRef={stopConversationRef} />
```

The `ChatInput.tsx` component is used within the `Chat.tsx` component to provide the chat input functionality. It is used like this:

```tsx
<ChatInput
  onSend={handleSend}
  onRegenerate={handleRegenerate}
  onScrollDownClick={handleScrollDown}
  stopConversationRef={stopConversationRef}
  textareaRef={textareaRef}
  showScrollDownButton={showScrollDownButton}
/>
```

The `ChatMessage.tsx` component is used within the `Chat.tsx` component to display each chat message. It is used like this:

```tsx
<MemoizedChatMessage
  key={message.id}
  message={message}
  messageIndex={messageIndex}
  onEdit={handleEdit}
/>
```

The `SystemPrompt.tsx` component is used within the `Chat.tsx` component to handle system prompts. It is used like this:

```tsx
<SystemPrompt
  conversation={selectedConversation}
  prompts={prompts}
  onChangePrompt={handleChangePrompt}
