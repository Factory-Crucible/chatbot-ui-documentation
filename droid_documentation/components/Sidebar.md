## components/Sidebar

The `components/Sidebar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It houses the TypeScript files that define the Sidebar component and its functionalities. The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The Sidebar component is not just a standalone entity but is composed of several other components, each with its specific styling and behavior. These components are defined in the files within this directory and its subdirectory `components/Sidebar/components`.

### Contents

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Sidebar component, exporting the main Sidebar component from 'Sidebar.tsx'.
- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `components/Sidebar/components`: This subdirectory contains additional component files for managing the sidebar, including 'OpenCloseButton.tsx', which exports two components responsible for opening and closing the sidebar.

### Key Components

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains several key components that contribute to the functionality of the Sidebar:

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Sidebar` directory are used to define and manage the Sidebar component within the chatbot UI project. Here are some examples of how these files are used:

- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is used throughout the application to provide a sidebar interface. The Sidebar component takes a variety of props including flags for whether it's open, the side it should appear on, and handlers for various actions such as creating items and folders, and handling search terms. It also accepts components to render items, folders, and a footer.

- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines the SidebarButton component, which is used within the Sidebar component to provide interactive buttons. The SidebarButton component accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. 'text' is a string that represents the button's label, 'icon' is a JSX.Element that represents the button's icon, and 'onClick' is a function that is executed when the button is clicked.

- `components/Sidebar/components/OpenCloseButton.tsx`: This file exports two components, 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton', which are used within the Sidebar component to provide functionality for opening and closing the sidebar. These components accept two props: 'onClick', a function that is triggered when the button is clicked, and 'side', a string that can be either 'left' or 'right', indicating the side of the screen where the sidebar is located.
