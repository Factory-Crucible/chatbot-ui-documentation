# `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It currently contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component named 'Navbar'. This component is specifically designed for the mobile application's navigation bar and is a critical part of the mobile user interface. The `Navbar` component is used within the chat application and is responsible for displaying the currently active chat and providing an interface for initiating new conversations.

## Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is a simple structure with a single file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines the `Navbar` functional component. This component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of the mobile chat application. It accepts two props: `selectedConversation`, which is an object of type `Conversation`, and `onNewConversation`, which is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button that, when clicked, triggers the `onNewConversation` function.

## Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the `Navbar` functional component, which is a critical part of the mobile user interface. This component is responsible for displaying the currently active chat and providing an interface for initiating new conversations. It accepts two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`. The `selectedConversation` prop is an object of type `Conversation` representing the currently active chat, while the `onNewConversation` prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated.

## Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the chat application to provide a navigation bar for the mobile version of the application. It is responsible for displaying the currently active chat and providing an interface for initiating new conversations.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used within the application:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object of type `Conversation` representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated. When the 'IconPlus' button within the `Navbar` component is clicked, it triggers the `handleNewConversation` function, initiating a new conversation.
