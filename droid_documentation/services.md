## Services Directory

The `services` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses two TypeScript files, `errorService.ts` and `useApiService.ts`, which define custom React hooks that are integral to the functionality of the chatbot UI. These hooks are responsible for handling API calls and providing localized error messages, respectively. They are designed to be reusable and modular, allowing them to be easily integrated into various parts of the codebase.

### Contents

The `services` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named `useErrorService`. This hook leverages the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next` to provide localized error messages. It returns a function `getModelsError` that takes an error object and returns an `ErrorMessage` object with a title, status code, and list of messages.

- `useApiService.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useApiService`. This hook uses another custom hook `useFetch` to make API calls. It provides a function `getModels` that makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint. The function accepts an object of type `GetModelsRequestProps` and an optional `AbortSignal`.

### Key Components

The `services` directory contains two key TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: The `useErrorService` hook defined in this file is crucial for providing localized error messages. By using the `useTranslation` hook, it ensures that error messages are displayed in the user's preferred language. The `getModelsError` function it returns is used throughout the codebase to handle errors and provide user-friendly error messages.

- `useApiService.ts`: The `useApiService` hook defined in this file is responsible for making API calls. It uses the `useFetch` hook to make these calls, providing a reusable and modular way to interact with APIs. The `getModels` function it provides is used to make POST requests to the `/api/models` endpoint, which is a key part of the chatbot's functionality.

### Usage & Examples

The `useErrorService` and `useApiService` hooks defined in the `services` directory are used throughout the codebase. They are imported into various components and modules, providing functionality for handling API calls and providing localized error messages.

For example, the `getModels` function provided by the `useApiService` hook might be used in a component to fetch data from the `/api/models` endpoint. This function would be called with an object of type `GetModelsRequestProps` and an optional `AbortSignal`, and the result of the fetch operation would be used to update the state of the component.

Similarly, the `getModelsError` function provided by the `useErrorService` hook might be used in a component to handle errors. This function would be called with an error object, and it would return an `ErrorMessage` object. This object would then be used to display a user-friendly error message in the component.

These examples illustrate the typical usage patterns of the hooks defined in the `services` directory. However, the actual usage of these hooks may vary depending on the specific requirements of the components and modules in which they are used.
