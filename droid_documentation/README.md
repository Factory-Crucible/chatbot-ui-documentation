Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the codebase and its structure, major components, technologies used, and conventions followed. This documentation is generated and maintained by the Documentation Droid, ensuring it stays up-to-date as the codebase evolves.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to facilitate the development of a chatbot user interface. It is a Docker-based Node.js project that uses TypeScript for static typing. The repository is part of a larger ecosystem, interacting with other services to provide a comprehensive chatbot solution.

### Technologies Used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies:

- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Docker**: A platform to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers.
- **Kubernetes**: An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components:

- **Components**: This directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different component of the chatbot UI.
- **Pages**: This directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests.
- **Utils**: This directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project.
- **Hooks**: This directory defines custom React hooks.
- **Services**: This directory contains services for error handling and API calls.
- **Types**: This directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants.
- **K8s**: This directory contains Kubernetes configurations.
- **__tests__**: This directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

### Conventions

The codebase follows certain conventions for better understanding and maintainability:

- **File Naming**: Files are named according to their functionality. For example, 'chat.ts' in the 'types' directory defines structures for chat systems.
- **Directory Structure**: The directory structure is semantic, with each directory housing related files. For example, the 'components' directory contains subdirectories for each component of the chatbot UI.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized in a way that makes it easy to navigate and understand. Here's a high-level overview of the directory structure:

```
.
├── __tests__
├── components
├── droid_documentation
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
├── public
├── services
├── styles
├── types
└── utils
```

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The codebase has several main flows that are crucial to understand:

- **Chat Flow**: The chat flow starts from the 'Chat' component in the 'components' directory. It handles the chat functionality, including sending and receiving messages, and interacting with the OpenAI API.
- **Settings Flow**: The settings flow is managed by the 'Settings' component. It handles the settings dialog, import functionality, and API key settings.
- **Prompt Flow**: The prompt flow is handled by the 'Promptbar' component. It manages prompts and folders in the sidebar of the UI.

### System Connections

The codebase interacts with several external systems:

- **OpenAI API**: The codebase makes POST requests to the OpenAI API for chat functionality. The 'api' directory in 'pages' contains files for handling these API requests and responses.
- **Google API**: The 'google.ts' file in the 'api' directory interacts with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API to generate prompts and send responses.

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows certain testing principles:

- **Unit Testing**: The '__tests__' directory contains unit tests for the application's utility functions. The 'importExports.test.ts' file validates the functionality of import and export operations.
- **Integration Testing**: The 'api' directory in 'pages' contains tests for API interactions, ensuring the correct functioning of the chatbot UI with external systems.
