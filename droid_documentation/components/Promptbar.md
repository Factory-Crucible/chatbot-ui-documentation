## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. The 'Promptbar' is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionality for managing prompts and folders. It is a React component written in TypeScript and is structured into several files and a subdirectory, each serving a specific purpose.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains five TypeScript files and a subdirectory named `components`. The TypeScript files include `index.ts`, `PromptBar.context.tsx`, `Promptbar.tsx`, and `Promptbar.state.tsx`. The `index.ts` file serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the default export from the `Promptbar.tsx` file. The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. The `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file, representing the sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders. The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.

The `components` subdirectory contains related components, including `Prompts.tsx`, `PromptbarSettings.tsx`, `Prompt.tsx`, `PromptModal.tsx`, and `PromptFolders.tsx`. Each of these files exports a React component that contributes to the functionality of the 'Promptbar'.

### Key Components

The `Promptbar.tsx` file is a key component in this directory. It represents the 'Promptbar' sidebar in the user interface and includes functions for managing prompts and folders. It uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects, and it imports several other components and contexts to provide its functionality.

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is another critical component. It defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. This context is used throughout the 'Promptbar' component and its subcomponents to manage state and handle user interactions.

The `components` subdirectory contains several important components. The `Prompt.tsx` file exports a 'PromptComponent' that handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and manages local state for various functionalities. The `PromptModal.tsx` file exports a component that renders a modal for editing a prompt, with internationalization support. The `PromptFolders.tsx` file exports a component that handles the display and functionality of folders within the 'Promptbar', including the dropping of prompts into folders.

### Usage & Examples

The 'Promptbar' component is used within the chatbot-ui project to provide a sidebar in the user interface for managing prompts and folders. The `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file, and it uses the context defined in the `PromptBar.context.tsx` file to manage state and handle user interactions.

The `Prompt.tsx` file exports a 'PromptComponent' that is used to handle actions, updates, and deletions of prompts. It manages local state for showing a modal, deleting, renaming, and the rename value. It also handles drag events for the prompt and uses effects to manage the renaming and deleting states.

The `PromptModal.tsx` file exports a component that is used to render a modal for editing a prompt. It takes in a prompt object, an onClose function, and an onUpdatePrompt function as props. The prompt object contains name, description, and content properties which are used to initialize state variables.

The `PromptFolders.tsx` file exports a component that is used to handle the display and functionality of folders within the 'Promptbar'. It handles the dropping of prompts into folders, updating the prompt's folderId when dropped.

The `PromptbarSettings.tsx` file, although currently returning an empty div, is likely to be used in the future to render settings related to the 'Promptbar'.
