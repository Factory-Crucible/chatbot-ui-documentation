## Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a pivotal part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the home for key files and subdirectories that define the structure and functionality of the application's pages. This directory is a unique feature of Next.js applications, where each file corresponds to a route in the application. The `pages` directory contains the main entry point for the home page (`index.tsx`), custom Document (`_document.tsx`), and App (`_app.tsx`) components for the Next.js application, and an `api` subdirectory for handling API requests and responses. These components and the `api` subdirectory work together to provide the user interface and functionality of the chatbot, including handling chat conversations, managing application settings, and interacting with local storage and external APIs.

### Contents

The `pages` directory contains three TypeScript files and one subdirectory:

- `index.tsx`: This file serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory.
- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.
- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api`: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

The `pages` directory contains several key components that are critical to the functionality of the chatbot-ui project:

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, which are crucial for rendering the home page and handling server-side rendering.
- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines the structure of the HTML document, including metadata and scripts, which are essential for the proper rendering and functionality of the application.
- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It plays a vital role in initializing the application and setting up the necessary libraries for its functionality.
- `api`: This subdirectory is responsible for handling API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, which are integral to the functionality of the chatbot.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used to define the structure and functionality of the application's pages. For instance, the `index.tsx` file is used to render the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory:

```typescript
export { default, getServerSideProps } from './api/home';
```

The `_document.tsx` file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts. Here is a simplified example of how it might be structured:

```typescript
type Props = DocumentProps & {};
export default function Document(props: Props) {}
```

The `_app.tsx` file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization. Here is a simplified example of how it might be structured:

```typescript
function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps<{}>) {}
```

The `api` subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses. For example, the `chat.ts` file serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality. It processes requests, encodes messages, and interacts with an OpenAI service:

```typescript
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};

const handler = async (req: Request): Promise<Response> => {};

export default handler;
```
