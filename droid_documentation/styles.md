## Styles Directory

The Styles directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. It houses the global styles for the project, which are defined in a single file, 'globals.css'. This file is responsible for the overall look and feel of the chatbot user interface, setting the stage for the visual experience of the users. It leverages the power of the Tailwind CSS framework, a utility-first CSS framework, to provide a consistent and scalable styling solution. The Styles directory does not contain any subdirectories, keeping the global styles centralized and easily manageable.

### Contents

The Styles directory contains a single file:

- `globals.css`: This is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file that contains global styles for the project. It includes the import of base, components, and utilities from Tailwind CSS. The file also contains custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, including its track, thumb, and corner, with different styles for hover states. It sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade. Additionally, it contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Lastly, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Key Components

The key component in the Styles directory is the `globals.css` file. This file is the backbone of the project's styling, defining the global styles that are applied throughout the application. It is responsible for the overall aesthetic of the chatbot user interface, including the background color, the styles for the webkit scrollbar, and the responsive design for smaller screens. It also includes specific styles for 'pre' elements, ensuring that code blocks are displayed correctly.

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file in the Styles directory is used to apply global styles to the chatbot user interface. It is imported into the project's main entry point, allowing the styles to be applied throughout the application. The file uses the Tailwind CSS framework to provide a consistent and scalable styling solution, and it includes custom styles for specific elements and conditions.

For example, the file includes a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px. This media query adjusts the width of 'pre' elements under this condition, ensuring that code blocks are displayed correctly on smaller screens. The file also removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock', providing a clean and uncluttered display for code blocks.

The `globals.css` file also sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade, providing a consistent background for the chatbot user interface. It includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, enhancing the user experience by providing a custom and consistent scrollbar design.
