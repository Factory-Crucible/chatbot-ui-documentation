## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a crucial part of the user interface, providing a visual indicator of loading states within the application. The Spinner component is a React component that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate that the application is processing data or waiting for a response from an API call. The directory contains two files: `Spinner.tsx` and `index.ts`, which together define and export the Spinner component.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. It is a React component that renders a spinner, typically used to indicate loading state in a user interface. The Spinner component accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop determines the height and width of the spinner, defaulting to '1em' if not provided. The 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner, defaulting to an empty string if not provided. The spinner is created using SVG and has an animation applied to it to create the spinning effect.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component. It exports the default export from the 'Spinner.tsx' file, which is the main Spinner component. This structure allows for cleaner imports elsewhere in the codebase, as one can import the Spinner component directly from 'components/Spinner' instead of having to specify the 'Spinner.tsx' file.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the Spinner component, defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file. This component is crucial for providing feedback to the user when the application is in a loading state. By accepting 'size' and 'className' as optional props, the Spinner component offers flexibility in its usage across the application, allowing for customization of its dimensions and styling as needed.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate loading states. It can be imported directly from the 'components/Spinner' directory, thanks to the export structure defined in the `index.ts` file.

Here is a simplified example of how the Spinner component might be used in a React component:

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate an API call
    setTimeout(() => {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }, 2000);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? <Spinner size="2em" className="text-blue-500" /> : <div>Data loaded</div>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

In this example, the Spinner component is displayed while the `isLoading` state is `true`. Once the simulated API call is complete (after 2 seconds), the `isLoading` state is set to `false`, and the Spinner component is replaced with a 'Data loaded' message. The Spinner component's size is set to '2em', and it is styled with a blue color using the 'text-blue-500' CSS class from Tailwind CSS.
