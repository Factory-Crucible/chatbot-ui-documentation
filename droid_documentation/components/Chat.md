## components/Chat Directory

The `components/Chat` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the hub for the chat functionality of the application. This directory contains a collection of TypeScript React components that together form the chat interface of the application. Each file in this directory corresponds to a specific feature or functionality of the chat interface, ranging from the main chat functionality to individual chat messages, system prompts, error messages, and various user interface elements such as dropdowns, sliders, and modals.

### Contents

The `components/Chat` directory contains 12 TypeScript files, each representing a unique React component that contributes to the overall chat functionality. The directory does not contain any subdirectories. The files in this directory are:

- `Chat.tsx`: Handles the main chat functionality.
- `ChatInput.tsx`: Provides the input functionality for the chat.
- `ChatLoader.tsx`: Displays a loading animation for the chat interface.
- `ChatMessage.tsx`: Represents a single chat message.
- `ErrorMessageDiv.tsx`: Displays error messages in a structured format.
- `MemoizedChatMessage.tsx`: Optimizes the rendering of chat messages.
- `ModelSelect.tsx`: Provides a dropdown selection interface for different AI models.
- `PluginSelect.tsx`: Provides a dropdown selection interface for different plugins.
- `PromptList.tsx`: Renders a list of prompts.
- `Regenerate.tsx`: Provides a UI for regenerating responses.
- `SystemPrompt.tsx`: Handles system prompts.
- `Temperature.tsx`: Provides a slider for adjusting the chatbot's response randomness.
- `VariableModal.tsx`: Provides a modal for handling variables.

### Key Components

The `components/Chat` directory contains several key components that are critical to the chat functionality of the application:

- `Chat.tsx`: This is the main component that handles the chat functionality of the application. It manages the sending of messages, updating of conversations, and handling of responses. It also manages scrolling and message updates.

- `ChatInput.tsx`: This component provides the input functionality for the chat. It handles changes, sends messages, stops the conversation, initializes the modal, handles key down events, parses variables, updates the prompt list visibility, selects prompts, and submits the form.

- `ChatMessage.tsx`: This component represents a single chat message in the chat interface. It provides functionalities to edit, delete, and copy a chat message. It also handles the display of the message based on the role of the sender (user or assistant).

- `SystemPrompt.tsx`: This component handles the system prompts in a chat conversation. It maintains several pieces of state, including the current value of the prompt, the active prompt index, whether the prompt list is visible, the prompt input value, an array of variables, and whether a modal is visible.
