## `types` Directory

The `types` directory is a crucial part of the codebase that houses TypeScript files defining various interfaces, types, and constants used throughout the project. These definitions provide a consistent structure for data across the application, ensuring type safety and enhancing code readability and maintainability. The directory contains files that define the structure of various parts of the project, including theme settings, key-value pair structures, prompt objects, Google's services, plugins, chat systems, environment variables for the OpenAI API, and the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.

### Contents

The `types` directory contains the following files:

- `data.ts`: Defines a key-value pair structure.
- `prompt.ts`: Outlines a prompt object.
- `plugin.ts`: Defines structures for plugins and chat systems.
- `settings.ts`: Defines theme settings.
- `storage.ts`: Defines the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.
- `openai.ts`: Defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers.
- `chat.ts`: Defines various interfaces and types related to a chat system.
- `export.ts`: Defines various types and interfaces related to the export functionality of the application.
- `google.ts`: Structures data related to Google's services.
- `folder.ts`: Defines a 'Folder' object.
- `index.ts`: An empty placeholder file.
- `env.ts`: Represents environment variables for the OpenAI API.
- `error.ts`: Structures error messages.

### Key Components

The `types` directory contains several key components that are critical to the functioning of the application:

- `data.ts`: This file defines the `KeyValuePair` interface, which is likely used throughout the project wherever a key-value pair structure is needed.
- `prompt.ts`: This file defines the `Prompt` interface, which is likely used to provide a consistent structure for prompt objects throughout the codebase.
- `plugin.ts`: This file defines the structure and data for plugins in the application, including interfaces for a plugin and its key, enums for plugin identification and naming, and a record of all plugins.
- `storage.ts`: This file defines the `LocalStorage` interface, which structures the local storage schema for the chatbot UI.
- `openai.ts`: This file defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers, including an interface for an OpenAI model, an enum for model identifiers, a fallback model identifier, and a record mapping model identifiers to their respective model details.
- `chat.ts`: This file defines various interfaces and types related to a chat system, including a message, a role, the body of a chat, and a conversation.
- `export.ts`: This file defines various types and interfaces related to the export functionality of the application, including different versions of the export format.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `types` directory are used throughout the codebase to provide consistent structure for data and enhance type safety. For example, the `KeyValuePair` interface defined in `data.ts` is likely used wherever a key-value pair structure is needed. Similarly, the `Prompt` interface defined in `prompt.ts` is likely used to structure prompt objects throughout the codebase.

The `plugin.ts` file is used to structure and manage plugins in the application. It defines interfaces for a plugin and its key, enums for plugin identification and naming, and a record of all plugins. This structure is likely used wherever plugins are managed in the application.

The `LocalStorage` interface defined in `storage.ts` is used to structure the local storage schema for the chatbot UI. This structure is likely used wherever local storage is accessed or manipulated in the application.

The `openai.ts` file is used to structure OpenAI models and their identifiers. It defines an interface for an OpenAI model, an enum for model identifiers, a fallback model identifier, and a record mapping model identifiers to their respective model details. This structure is likely used wherever OpenAI models are used in the application.

The `chat.ts` file is used to structure various aspects of a chat system, including a message, a role, the body of a chat, and a conversation. These structures are likely used wherever chat systems are managed in the application.

The `export.ts` file is used to structure the export functionality of the application. It defines different versions of the export format, which are likely used whenever data is exported from the application.
