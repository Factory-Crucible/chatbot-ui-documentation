## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The Spinner component is a crucial part of the user interface, providing users with a visual cue that an operation is in progress and that they should wait for it to complete.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component. It exports the default export from the `Spinner.tsx` file, simplifying imports elsewhere in the project.
- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. It accepts 'size' and 'className' as optional props, with 'size' controlling the spinner's dimensions and 'className' allowing for additional CSS classes.

The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Spinner.tsx` file. This file defines the Spinner component, which is a critical part of the user interface. The Spinner component provides a visual indication of a loading state, improving the user experience by providing feedback during operations that may take some time to complete.

The `index.ts` file is also a key part of this directory, as it simplifies the import process for the Spinner component elsewhere in the project.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate loading states. It can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` thanks to the `index.ts` file.

The Spinner component accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop controls the dimensions of the spinner, defaulting to '1em' if not provided. The 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner, defaulting to an empty string if not provided.

Here is an example of how the Spinner component might be used in a component that fetches data:

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

const FetchingDataComponent = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData().then(() => {
      setIsLoading(false);
    });
  }, []);

  if (isLoading) {
    return <Spinner size="2em" className="text-blue-500" />;
  }

  // Render the fetched data...
};
```

In this example, the Spinner component is rendered while the data is being fetched. The 'size' prop is set to '2em', making the spinner larger than its default size, and the 'className' prop is set to 'text-blue-500', applying a blue color to the spinner.
