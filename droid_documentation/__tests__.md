# __tests__ Directory Documentation

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation project. It is an integral part of the project's engineering practices, ensuring the reliability and maintainability of the codebase. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. The `utils` subdirectory further contains an `app` subdirectory, which houses a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- `utils`: A subdirectory that serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. It contains a subdirectory named `app`.

  - `app`: A subdirectory within `utils` that houses a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file validates the functionality of import and export operations.

## Key Components

The key component within the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file located in the `app` subdirectory of `utils`. This file plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of the application's import and export operations. It tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one, ensuring that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house all the test files and suites for the application. The `utils` subdirectory within it is specifically used for testing utility functions. For instance, the `importExports.test.ts` file within the `app` subdirectory of `utils` is used to test the import and export operations of the application.

The `importExports.test.ts` file contains several test suites and test cases. For example, it includes test suites for different versions of the export format, with test cases that check whether a given object matches the expected format for each version. It also includes a test suite for the `cleanData` function, with test cases that check whether the cleaned data matches the expected structure of the latest format.

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {
    it('should return true for v1 format', () => {});
    it('should return false for non-v1 formats', () => {});
  });
  // Similar test suites for other versions...
});

describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
  describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {
    it('should return the latest format', () => {});
  });
  // Similar test suites for other versions...
});
```

This code snippet is a simplified representation of the structure of the `importExports.test.ts` file. It shows how the file is organized into different test suites for different versions of the export format and the `cleanData` function. Each test suite contains multiple test cases that validate specific aspects of the functionality being tested.
