# `__tests__` Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing within the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It is structured to reflect the organization of the codebase, with a focus on testing the utility functions of the application. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which houses a further subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`, which is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains one subdirectory:

- `utils`: This subdirectory serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. It contains a further subdirectory named `app`.

The `utils` subdirectory contains one subdirectory:

- `app`: This subdirectory houses a test file named `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.

The `app` subdirectory contains one file:

- `importExports.test.ts`: This file tests utility functions related to import and export operations in the application.

## Key Components

The key component within the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file. This file is critical as it ensures the integrity of the import and export operations of the application. It validates that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house tests for the application's utility functions. The `importExports.test.ts` file within the `app` subdirectory is a representative example of how these tests are structured and used. This file contains tests for different versions of the export format, checking whether a given object matches the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest format. The tests ensure that the cleaned data matches the expected structure of the latest format.

For example, the `importExports.test.ts` file contains a series of `describe` and `it` blocks that define the tests. The `describe` blocks group related tests together, while the `it` blocks define individual tests. Each `it` block contains an assertion that checks a specific aspect of the functionality being tested. For instance, there are `it` blocks that check whether the `isExportFormatV1` function returns true for v1 format and false for non-v1 formats, and so on for other versions. Similarly, there are `it` blocks that check whether the `cleanData` function returns the latest format when cleaning v1, v2, and v4 data.
