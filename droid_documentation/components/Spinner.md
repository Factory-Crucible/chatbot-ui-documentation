## components/Spinner

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. This component is a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The Spinner component is a crucial part of the user experience, providing feedback to the user when an operation is in progress and preventing confusion or frustration that might occur due to unresponsive UI.

The Spinner component is built using React and TypeScript, and it is designed to be reusable across different parts of the application. It accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop controls the dimensions of the spinner, while the 'className' prop allows for the addition of custom CSS classes. The spinner is created using SVG and includes an animation for the spinning effect.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. It includes the component's props, the SVG for the spinner, and the animation for the spinning effect.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component, exporting the default export from `Spinner.tsx`. This setup simplifies imports elsewhere in the project, as the Spinner component can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` without specifying the `Spinner.tsx` file.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Spinner.tsx` file. This file defines the Spinner component, which is a critical part of the user interface. The Spinner component is used throughout the application to indicate loading states, providing a visual cue to the user that an operation is in progress. This component is designed to be reusable, with customizable size and CSS classes, making it a versatile part of the codebase.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the application whenever a loading state needs to be indicated. It can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` thanks to the `index.ts` file, which exports the Spinner component as its default export.

Here is a simplified example of how the Spinner component might be used in a React component:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

const LoadingComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <p>Loading data...</p>
    <Spinner size="2em" className="my-spinner" />
  </div>
);

export default LoadingComponent;
```

In this example, the Spinner component is imported from `components/Spinner` and used in a `LoadingComponent`. The `size` prop is set to '2em', making the spinner twice the size of the default, and the `className` prop is set to 'my-spinner', allowing for additional styling via CSS.
