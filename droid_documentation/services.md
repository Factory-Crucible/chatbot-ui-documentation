## Services Directory

The `services` directory is a critical part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses two TypeScript files, `errorService.ts` and `useApiService.ts`, which define custom React hooks that are integral to the functionality of the chatbot UI. These hooks, `useErrorService` and `useApiService`, provide localized error messages and make API calls respectively. The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Contents

The `services` directory contains the following files:

- `errorService.ts`: This TypeScript file exports a custom React hook named `useErrorService` that provides localized error messages using the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next`. The hook returns a function `getModelsError` that takes an error object and returns an `ErrorMessage` object with a title, status code, and list of messages.

- `useApiService.ts`: This TypeScript file defines a custom React hook named `useApiService` that uses another custom hook `useFetch` to make API calls. The hook provides a function `getModels` which makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint.

### Key Components

The `services` directory contains two key TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: The `useErrorService` hook defined in this file is crucial for providing localized error messages to the user. It uses the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next` to translate error messages, ensuring that users receive error information in their preferred language. The `getModelsError` function it returns takes an error object and returns an `ErrorMessage` object, providing a structured way to handle and display errors.

- `useApiService.ts`: The `useApiService` hook defined in this file is responsible for making API calls to the `/api/models` endpoint. It uses the `useFetch` hook to make these calls, and provides a `getModels` function that accepts an object of type `GetModelsRequestProps` and an optional `AbortSignal`. This hook is integral to the interaction between the chatbot UI and the backend API.

### Usage & Examples

The `services` directory is used to define custom hooks that are used throughout the chatbot UI codebase. These hooks provide critical functionality, such as localized error messages and API calls.

For instance, the `useErrorService` hook can be used in a component to get a localized error message. The `getModelsError` function it returns can be used to handle errors from API calls, providing a structured and localized error message.

Similarly, the `useApiService` hook can be used to make API calls to the `/api/models` endpoint. The `getModels` function it provides can be used to fetch models from the backend API, providing a simple and consistent way to interact with the API.

Please note that the code snippets provided in the `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE` are not representative of typical usage patterns. They are provided to give a sense of the structure and functionality of the hooks defined in the `services` directory.
