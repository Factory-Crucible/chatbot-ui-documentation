Welcome to the documentation for the `Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation` repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. The documentation is generated and maintained by the Documentation Droid, ensuring it remains up-to-date as the codebase evolves.

## Overview

### Purpose

The `Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation` repository is dedicated to the development of a chatbot user interface (UI). The chatbot UI is a key component of our larger system, interacting with various services to provide a seamless user experience.

### Technologies Used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies, including Docker, Node.js, TypeScript, and React. Docker is used for creating a consistent environment for the application, while Node.js serves as the runtime for executing JavaScript code server-side. TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, is used for writing the application code, providing type safety and enhancing developer productivity. React, a popular JavaScript library, is used for building the UI components of the chatbot.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components, including a frontend library, a backend library, and a command-line interface (CLI). The frontend library is responsible for rendering the chatbot UI, while the backend library handles API requests and responses. The CLI provides a way to interact with the application through the command line.

### Conventions

The codebase follows certain conventions for file naming and structure. For instance, directories are named according to their functionality, and files within these directories are named in camelCase. TypeScript is used throughout the codebase, with `.ts` and `.tsx` file extensions for regular TypeScript and TypeScript with JSX syntax, respectively.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into various directories, each serving a specific purpose. Some directories contain a significant amount of code, while others house static assets and are rarely utilized. The structure of the codebase is as follows:

```
.
├── __tests__
├── components
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
├── public
├── services
├── styles
├── types
└── utils
```

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the chatbot UI. These flows include user interactions with the chatbot, API calls to external services, and the rendering of UI components. For instance, when a user interacts with the chatbot, an API request is made to the backend, which then interacts with external services to generate a response. This response is then rendered in the chatbot UI.

### System Connections

The chatbot UI interacts with several internal and external systems. Internally, it communicates with our backend services to handle user requests and responses. Externally, it interacts with services such as OpenAI and Google APIs to generate chatbot responses and perform searches. Understanding these system connections is crucial for comprehending the data flow within the application.

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows certain testing principles to ensure the quality and reliability of the application. These principles include unit testing individual functions and components, integration testing to check the interaction between different parts of the application, and end-to-end testing to validate the application as a whole. The `__tests__` directory is dedicated to testing within the project.
