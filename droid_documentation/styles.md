## Styles Directory

The Styles directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. It houses the global styles that are applied across the entire project. The directory contains a single file, 'globals.css', which is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file. This file is responsible for defining the look and feel of the user interface, ensuring a consistent and appealing visual experience for the users of the chatbot.

### Contents

The Styles directory is straightforward and contains only one file:

- `globals.css`: This is a CSS file that holds the global styles for the project. It imports base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework and includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. The file also sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade. It contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Additionally, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Key Components

The key component in the Styles directory is the `globals.css` file. This file is critical because it sets the global styles for the entire project. It is here that the project's visual identity is defined, and it is this file that ensures a consistent look and feel across the entire user interface. 

The `globals.css` file is also important because it imports base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework. This framework is a utility-first CSS framework that is highly customizable and efficient, making it a key part of the project's styling strategy.

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file is used by the entire project to apply global styles. It is loaded by the Next.js application and applied to the entire document. This ensures that the styles defined in this file are applied across all components and pages in the project.

For example, the file sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade. This means that all pages and components in the project will have this background color, unless overridden by more specific styles.

The file also contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px. This media query adjusts the width of 'pre' elements under this condition, ensuring that the layout of the project is responsive and works well on smaller screens.

Lastly, the file removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'. This is an example of how the file can target specific elements and apply styles based on certain conditions, providing a high level of control over the project's styling.
