## Types Directory

The `types` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses TypeScript files that define various interfaces, types, and constants used throughout the project. These definitions provide a consistent structure for data and ensure type safety, which is a key aspect of TypeScript. The types defined in this directory are used across different components, services, and utilities of the chatbot UI, contributing to the overall functionality and robustness of the application.

### Contents

The `types` directory is composed of several TypeScript files, each serving a specific purpose. There are no subdirectories within this directory. The files include:

- `data.ts`: Defines a key-value pair structure.
- `prompt.ts`: Outlines a prompt object.
- `plugin.ts`: Defines structures for plugins.
- `settings.ts`: Defines theme settings.
- `storage.ts`: Defines the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.
- `openai.ts`: Defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers.
- `chat.ts`: Defines structures for chat systems.
- `export.ts`: Relates to the application's export functionality.
- `google.ts`: Structures data related to Google's services.
- `folder.ts`: Defines a 'Folder' object.
- `index.ts`: An empty placeholder file.
- `error.ts`: Structures error messages.
- `env.ts`: Represents environment variables for the OpenAI API.

### Key Components

Several files in the `types` directory play a critical role in the chatbot UI application:

- `settings.ts`: This file defines the theme settings for the application, ensuring a consistent user experience across different parts of the application.
- `storage.ts`: This file defines the local storage schema, which is crucial for persisting user data and state across sessions.
- `openai.ts`: This file defines the structure of OpenAI models, which are central to the chatbot's functionality.
- `chat.ts`: This file defines various interfaces and types related to a chat system, which is the core functionality of the chatbot UI.

### Usage & Examples

The types defined in this directory are used throughout the codebase. For instance, the `Prompt` interface defined in `prompt.ts` is used to structure prompt objects, which are central to the chatbot's functionality. Similarly, the `Settings` interface defined in `settings.ts` is used to manage the theme settings of the application.

Here is an example of how the `Prompt` interface might be used:

```typescript
let prompt: Prompt = {
  id: '1',
  name: 'Greeting',
  description: 'A greeting message',
  content: 'Hello, how can I assist you today?',
  model: OpenAIModels.GPT_3_5,
  folderId: null
};
```

In this example, a prompt object is created with the `Prompt` interface. The object includes an id, name, description, content, model, and folderId. The model is obtained from the `OpenAIModels` record defined in `openai.ts`.

Please note that this is a simplified example and the actual usage may vary based on the context and requirements of the application.
