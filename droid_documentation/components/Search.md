## components/Search

The `components/Search` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project. It houses the `Search` component, a functional React component written in TypeScript. This component is responsible for rendering the search input field and the 'X' icon in the user interface. The search input field is used to display and update the current search term, while the 'X' icon is used to clear the search input. The `Search` component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' prop is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' prop represents the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates this term. 

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two main files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that exports a functional component named 'Search'. The component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' prop is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' prop represents the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.
- `index.ts`: This is a simple TypeScript file that exports the default export from the sibling file 'Search.tsx'. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory. In this case, any other parts of the code that import from the 'Search' directory will automatically receive the default export from 'Search.tsx'.

### Key Components

The `Search.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It exports a functional React component named 'Search' that is responsible for rendering the search input field and the 'X' icon in the user interface. The component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' prop is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' prop represents the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.

### Usage & Examples

The `Search` component is used in the user interface to provide a search functionality. It is used wherever a search input field is required in the user interface. The 'placeholder' prop can be used to provide a hint to the user about what they can search for. The 'searchTerm' prop is used to display and update the current search term. The 'onSearch' prop is a function that is called when the value of the search input field changes or when the 'X' icon is clicked.

For example, the `Search` component can be used in a parent component as follows:

```typescript
<Search 
  placeholder="Search for a chatbot..." 
  searchTerm={this.state.searchTerm} 
  onSearch={this.handleSearchChange} 
/>
```

In this example, `this.state.searchTerm` is the current search term, and `this.handleSearchChange` is a method in the parent component that updates the search term.
