Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the repository, its purpose, the technologies used, major components, conventions, structure, main flows, and testing principles. These docs are generated and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes by the Documentation Droid.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to create a user interface for a chatbot. It is a Docker-based Node.js project that uses TypeScript for static type checking. The repository is part of a larger system where it interacts with other services to provide a comprehensive chatbot solution.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies. It uses Node.js as the runtime environment and TypeScript for static type checking. The project uses React for building the user interface and Next.js for server-side rendering. For styling, it uses Tailwind CSS and PostCSS. The project also uses Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, while the 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The '__tests__' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

### Conventions

The codebase follows several conventions. File naming follows the convention of using camelCase for JavaScript and TypeScript files. The project uses the '__tests__' directory for testing. The 'types' directory is used for defining TypeScript types, interfaces, and constants. The 'utils' directory is used for utility functions, and the 'services' directory is used for service functions.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. The root directory contains configuration files for the project, Docker, and various tools like Makefile, Prettier, PostCSS, and Tailwind CSS. It also includes a Dockerfile for creating a Docker image and a 'docker-compose.yml' for defining and managing the Docker application. The 'package.json' file lists the project's dependencies and scripts. The project uses TypeScript, with the 'tsconfig.json' file configuring the TypeScript compiler.

The 'public' directory contains branding files and a 'screenshots' subdirectory. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, while the 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The '__tests__' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

The directory structure is as follows:

```

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the chatbot UI. The 'pages' directory contains the main entry points for the application, with 'index.tsx' serving as the home page. The 'api' subdirectory handles API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs. The 'components' directory contains various parts of the project, each handling different aspects of the UI. The 'utils' directory contains utility functions that support these flows.

For a more in-depth understanding of the flows, refer to the ['pages.md'](./pages.md) and ['components/README.md'](./components/README.md) documentation files.

### System Connections

The system interacts with external services like OpenAI and Google APIs. The 'pages/api' directory contains files for handling these API requests and responses. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'utils' directory contains utility functions that support these interactions.

For a detailed explanation of the system connections, refer to the ['services.md'](./services.md) and ['utils.md'](./utils.md) documentation files.

## Testing Principles

The '__tests__' directory is dedicated to testing the application. It contains a 'utils' subdirectory that serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. The 'importExports.test.ts' file validates the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version.

For a detailed explanation of the testing principles, refer to the ['__tests__.md'](./__tests__.md) documentation file.
