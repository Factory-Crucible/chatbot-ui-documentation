# `components/Promptbar` Directory

## Folder Name

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the `integration-chatbot-ui` project. It contains the code for the `Promptbar` component, which is responsible for handling various operations on prompts, such as creating, deleting, and updating. The `Promptbar` component also uses hooks for state management and internationalization.

## Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains the following files:

- `index.ts`: This file exports the `Promptbar` component.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file manages the state of the `Promptbar` component, defining an interface and an initial state.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is a React component file that handles various operations on prompts.
- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This file defines the context for the `Promptbar` component, including state, dispatch function, and handlers.

The directory also contains a subdirectory:

- `components/Promptbar/components`: This subdirectory contains five files, each defining a unique React component.

## Folder Structure Overview

The `components/Promptbar` directory follows a modular structure, with each file serving a specific purpose. The `index.ts` file serves as the entry point, exporting the `Promptbar` component. The `Promptbar.state.tsx` and `PromptBar.context.tsx` files handle the state and context of the `Promptbar` component, respectively. The `Promptbar.tsx` file contains the main `Promptbar` component.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory contains individual components that are part of the `Promptbar` component. These include settings, rendering of prompts, modal dialog, handling item drops and filtering prompts, and updates and deletions of prompts.

## Key Components

The `Promptbar.tsx` file is a key component in this directory. It contains the main `Promptbar` component, which handles various operations on prompts and uses hooks for state management and internationalization. The `Promptbar.state.tsx` and `PromptBar.context.tsx` files are also critical as they manage the state and context of the `Promptbar` component, respectively.

In the `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory, the `Prompt.tsx` file is notable as it exports a `PromptComponent` that handles updates and deletions of prompts, maintains its own state, and returns a JSX structure with action buttons and a `PromptModal`.

## Usage & Examples

The `Promptbar` component is used within the `integration-chatbot-ui` project to handle operations on prompts. It uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization and the `useCreateReducer` hook for state management. It also uses the `HomeContext` and `PromptbarContext` for managing state and dispatching actions.

For example, the `Promptbar` component includes handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts. These handlers interact with the `HomeContext` and local storage. The component also includes a `useEffect` hook to filter prompts based on a search term.

The `Promptbar` component is wrapped in a `PromptbarContext.Provider` and returns a `Sidebar` component with various props. This allows the `Promptbar` component to be used in different parts of the application, providing a consistent interface for interacting with prompts.
