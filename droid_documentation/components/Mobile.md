## `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a specialized directory that houses the `Navbar.tsx` file, a TypeScript file that defines a functional component for the mobile application's navigation bar. This directory is a critical part of the chatbot-ui project, as it ensures the application is mobile-friendly and provides a seamless user experience on mobile devices.

### Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory contains a single file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines a functional component named 'Navbar' for the mobile application's navigation bar. It is designed to be used in a chat application and accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Navbar` component defined in the `Navbar.tsx` file. This component is crucial as it provides the navigation bar for the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation', an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat, and 'onNewConversation', a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated.

### Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is responsible for displaying the name of the currently selected conversation and providing an 'IconPlus' button for initiating new conversations.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that gets triggered when the 'IconPlus' button is clicked to start a new conversation.
