## `components/Search` Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a crucial part of the `integration-chatbot-ui` project. It houses the `Search` component, which is a functional React component that provides the search functionality within the application. This component is responsible for rendering an input field and an icon, and it manages the state of the input field. It also supports internationalization using the `next-i18next` library.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `index.ts`: This is an index file that exports the default from the `Search.tsx` file. It does not contain any classes, functions, or structures.

- `Search.tsx`: This file exports a functional component named `Search`. This component accepts three props: `placeholder`, `searchTerm`, and `onSearch`. It uses the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next` for internationalization. The component also defines two local functions: `handleSearchChange` and `clearSearch` that manage the input field's value.

### Folder Structure Overview

The `components/Search` directory follows a simple structure with two files. The `index.ts` file serves as an entry point to the directory, exporting the `Search` component from the `Search.tsx` file. The `Search.tsx` file contains the actual implementation of the `Search` component.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Search` component defined in the `Search.tsx` file. This component is a functional React component that provides the search functionality within the application. It accepts three props: `placeholder`, `searchTerm`, and `onSearch`. The `placeholder` and `searchTerm` are strings, while `onSearch` is a function that takes a string as an argument. The component uses the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next` to support internationalization.

### Usage & Examples

The `Search` component is used within the application to provide a search interface. It is a reusable component that can be included in any part of the application where a search functionality is required.

Here is an example of how to use the `Search` component:

```jsx
import Search from './components/Search';

function App() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

  const handleSearch = (term) => {
    setSearchTerm(term);
    // Perform search operation here
  };

  return (
    <Search
      placeholder="Search here..."
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      onSearch={handleSearch}
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, the `Search` component is imported from the `components/Search` directory. It is then used in the `App` component with the `placeholder`, `searchTerm`, and `onSearch` props. The `handleSearch` function is called whenever the value of the input field changes, updating the `searchTerm` state and triggering a search operation.
