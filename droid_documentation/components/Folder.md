## components/Folder

The `components/Folder` directory is a crucial part of the `chatbot-ui` project. It houses the React component that represents a folder in the file system. This component is integral to the user interface of the chatbot, as it provides a visual representation of a folder and allows users to interact with it. The folder component is designed to be interactive, with functionality for renaming, deleting, and handling drag and drop events. It also maintains its own state, including whether it is being renamed or deleted, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two main files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. The `Folder` component represents a folder in a file system and includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. It also maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed.

- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this folder by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects to simplify imports from a directory.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Folder` component, which is defined in the `Folder.tsx` file. This component is crucial to the user interface of the chatbot, as it provides a visual representation of a folder and allows users to interact with it. The `Folder` component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It also maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used throughout the `chatbot-ui` project to represent a folder in the file system. It is used in various parts of the user interface, including the sidebar and the main content area. The component is designed to be interactive, allowing users to rename and delete folders, as well as handle drag and drop events.

For example, the `Folder` component might be used in the sidebar to display a list of folders. Each folder would be represented by a `Folder` component, which would display the name of the folder and allow the user to interact with it. The `Folder` component would maintain its own state, including whether it is being renamed or deleted, and whether it is open or closed.

The `Folder` component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. The current folder prop is used to determine the state of the component, while the search term prop is used to filter the list of folder components. The drop handler prop is used to handle drag and drop events, and the list of folder components prop is used to render the child folders.

```typescript
interface Props {
  currentFolder: FolderInterface;
  searchTerm: string;
  handleDrop: (e: any, folder: FolderInterface) => void;
  folderComponent: (ReactElement | undefined)[];
}

const Folder = ({
  currentFolder,
  searchTerm,
  handleDrop,
  folderComponent,
}: Props) => {}
```

The `Folder` component is exported from the `Folder.tsx` file, and can be imported into other files using the `index.ts` file in the same directory. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects to simplify imports from a directory.

```typescript
export { default } from './Folder';
```
