## types
The `types` directory contains TypeScript files that define various interfaces, types, and constants used throughout the project. These definitions provide a consistent structure for data across the codebase, ensuring that all components interact with data in a predictable and reliable manner.

### Contents
The `types` directory contains the following files:

- `data.ts`: Defines a 'KeyValuePair' interface representing a key-value pair structure.
- `prompt.ts`: Defines a 'Prompt' interface representing a prompt object.
- `plugin.ts`: Defines the structure and data for plugins in the application.
- `settings.ts`: Defines a 'Settings' interface specifying the theme settings for the application.
- `storage.ts`: Defines the structure of the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.
- `openai.ts`: Defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers.
- `chat.ts`: Defines various interfaces and types related to a chat system.
- `export.ts`: Defines various types and interfaces related to the export functionality of the application.
- `google.ts`: Defines several interfaces related to Google's services.
- `folder.ts`: Defines the structure of a 'Folder' object within the project.
- `index.ts`: An empty placeholder file.
- `env.ts`: Defines an interface representing the environment variables related to the OpenAI API.
- `error.ts`: Defines an interface used to structure the error messages in the application.

### Key Components
Key files in this directory include `data.ts`, `prompt.ts`, `plugin.ts`, `settings.ts`, `storage.ts`, `openai.ts`, `chat.ts`, `export.ts`, `google.ts`, `folder.ts`, `env.ts`, and `error.ts`. Each of these files defines a specific type or interface that is used across the codebase, providing a consistent structure for data and ensuring that all components interact with data in a predictable and reliable manner.

### Usage & Examples
The types and interfaces defined in this directory are used throughout the codebase. For example, the 'KeyValuePair' interface defined in `data.ts` is likely used wherever a key-value pair structure is needed. Similarly, the 'Prompt' interface defined in `prompt.ts` provides a consistent structure for prompt objects throughout the codebase. The 'Settings' interface in `settings.ts` is used across the application to ensure consistent usage of the theme settings.
