# **tests** Directory Documentation

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the `chatbot-ui` project. It is a crucial part of the project's engineering practices, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the code. The directory is structured to reflect the organization of the codebase, with a focus on testing the utility functions of the application. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for these utility functions. Within `utils`, there's another subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains one subdirectory:

- `utils`: This directory is a testing suite for the utility functions within the application. It contains a subdirectory named `app`.

The `utils` directory contains one subdirectory:

- `app`: This directory contains test files for the application's utility functions. Specifically, it includes a file named `importExports.test.ts`.

The `app` directory contains one file:

- `importExports.test.ts`: This is a test file for utility functions related to import and export operations in the application.

## Key Components

The key component in the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file. This file tests the utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It verifies different versions of the export format, ensuring that a given object matches the expected format for each version. The file also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest one, and checks that the cleaned data aligns with the expected structure of the latest format.

## Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to ensure the correctness and reliability of the codebase. The tests within this directory are run as part of the project's continuous integration and deployment pipelines, ensuring that the codebase is always in a deployable state.

The `importExports.test.ts` file, for example, is used to test the utility functions related to import and export operations. The file contains several `describe` and `it` blocks, each testing a specific aspect of these utility functions. For instance, there are `describe` blocks for each version of the export format, with `it` blocks within each `describe` block testing whether a given object matches the expected format for that version. There are also `describe` and `it` blocks for the `cleanData` function, testing whether it correctly converts data from older export formats to the latest format.

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {
    it('should return true for v1 format', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
    it('should return false for non-v1 formats', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
  });
  // Similar blocks for other versions
});

describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
  describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {
    it('should return the latest format', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
  });
  // Similar blocks for other versions
});
```

This example shows the structure of the tests within the `importExports.test.ts` file. Each `describe` block groups related tests together, and each `it` block contains a single test. The comments within the `it` blocks would be replaced with the actual test code.
