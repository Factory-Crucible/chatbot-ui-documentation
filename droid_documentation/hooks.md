## The 'hooks' Directory

The 'hooks' directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. It houses two TypeScript files that define custom React hooks, namely 'useCreateReducer.ts' and 'useFetch.ts'. These hooks are instrumental in managing state and making HTTP requests within the chatbot-ui project. The 'useCreateReducer' hook provides a typed reducer with dispatch and state, while the 'useFetch' hook offers a convenient way to make HTTP requests. Both hooks are designed to be reusable and efficient, contributing to the overall functionality and scalability of the chatbot-ui project.

### Contents

The 'hooks' directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named 'useCreateReducer' and two TypeScript types, 'FieldNames' and 'ActionType'. The 'useCreateReducer' hook is designed to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state, while the 'FieldNames' and 'ActionType' types help manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.

- `useFetch.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named 'useFetch' and two TypeScript types, 'RequestModel' and 'RequestWithBodyModel'. The 'useFetch' hook provides methods for making HTTP requests, while the 'RequestModel' and 'RequestWithBodyModel' types structure the request parameters.

### Key Components

The 'hooks' directory contains two key components:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file is a critical part of the state management in the chatbot-ui project. The 'useCreateReducer' hook it defines allows for the creation of a reducer with typed dispatch and state, ensuring type safety and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors. The 'FieldNames' and 'ActionType' types it also defines are used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action, providing a clear and consistent structure for state management.

- `useFetch.ts`: This file is essential for making HTTP requests within the chatbot-ui project. The 'useFetch' hook it exports provides methods for each HTTP verb, making it easy to make HTTP requests in a consistent and reusable manner. The 'RequestModel' and 'RequestWithBodyModel' types it defines structure the request parameters, ensuring that all requests have a consistent and predictable format.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the 'hooks' directory are used throughout the chatbot-ui project to manage state and make HTTP requests.

- The 'useCreateReducer' hook defined in the 'useCreateReducer.ts' file is used to create reducers with typed dispatch and state. For example, it might be used to create a reducer for managing the state of a chat conversation, with actions for adding, removing, and updating chat messages.

- The 'useFetch' hook defined in the 'useFetch.ts' file is used to make HTTP requests. For example, it might be used to make a GET request to fetch chat messages from an API, or a POST request to send a new chat message to an API.

Note: The above examples are hypothetical and may not represent the actual usage patterns in the chatbot-ui project. They are provided to illustrate the potential uses of the 'useCreateReducer' and 'useFetch' hooks.
