## Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a critical component of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the container for key files and subdirectories that define the structure and behavior of the application's pages. This directory is a fundamental part of the Next.js framework, which treats every file in the `pages` directory as a route in the application. The files in this directory are responsible for rendering the user interface, handling API requests, and managing the state of the application. The `pages` directory also includes an `api` subdirectory, which contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with external APIs such as OpenAI and Google APIs, and managing the 'home' page of the application.

### Contents

The `pages` directory contains three TypeScript files and one subdirectory:

- `index.tsx`: This is the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function.
- `_document.tsx`: This is a custom Document for the Next.js application, defining an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.
- `_app.tsx`: This is a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api`: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

The `pages` directory contains several key files that are crucial to the functioning of the chatbot-ui application:

- `index.tsx`: This file serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from a sibling file in the 'api' subdirectory named 'home'.
- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts. The 'Document' function it defines takes 'props' as a parameter, which is a combination of 'DocumentProps' and custom document properties.
- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api`: This subdirectory is a crucial part of the application, handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and managing the 'home' page of the application.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories in the `pages` directory are used to define the structure and behavior of the application's pages. For example, the `index.tsx` file is the main entry point for the application's home page, exporting a React component and a server-side rendering function. The `_document.tsx` file is a custom Document for the Next.js application, defining an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts. The `_app.tsx` file is a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.

The `api` subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and managing the 'home' page of the application. For instance, the `models.ts` file handles requests related to OpenAI models, constructing URLs and fetching data from the OpenAI API. The `chat.ts` file serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality, processing requests, encoding messages, and interacting with an OpenAI service. The `google.ts` file handles API requests and responses, interacting with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API to generate prompts and send responses.

The 'home' subdirectory within the 'api' directory contains files related to the 'home' page of the application. The 'home.tsx' file is a React component that serves as the main page, managing state and handling API calls. The 'home.context.tsx' file defines the context for the 'home' page, outlining the 'HomeContextProps' interface and creating the 'HomeContext'. The 'home.state.tsx' file defines the initial state for the 'Home' page, declaring the 'HomeInitialState' interface and exporting the 'initialState' constant.
