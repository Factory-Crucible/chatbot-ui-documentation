Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the codebase and its structure, major components, technologies used, and conventions followed. This documentation is generated and maintained by the Documentation Droid and will be kept up to date as the codebase evolves.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to create a user-friendly chatbot UI. It is a Docker-based Node.js project that uses TypeScript for static typing. The chatbot UI is part of a larger system and interacts with other services, such as OpenAI and Google APIs, to provide a seamless user experience.

### Technologies Used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies:

- **Node.js**: The project is built on Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows for the development of scalable network applications.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, is used throughout the project to ensure type safety and improve developer productivity.
- **React**: The UI components are built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Docker**: Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring that it works uniformly across different computing environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Kubernetes configurations are included in the codebase for managing containerized applications in various environments.
- **Next.js**: Next.js, a React framework, is used for server-side rendering, static site generation, and creating API endpoints.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components:

- **Components**: The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different aspect of the chatbot UI.
- **Pages**: The 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests.
- **Utils**: The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project.
- **Hooks**: The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks.
- **Services**: The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls.
- **Types**: The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants.

### Conventions

The codebase follows several conventions:

- **File Naming**: Files are named according to their purpose and functionality. For example, 'chat.ts' in the 'types' directory defines structures for chat systems.
- **Directory Structure**: The directory structure is organized semantically, with each directory housing related files. For example, the 'components' directory contains subdirectories for each component of the chatbot UI.
- **Testing**: The '__tests__' directory is dedicated to testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory serving as a testing suite.

## Structure

The codebase is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. Here is a high-level overview of the directory structure:

```
.
├── __tests__
├── components
├── droid_documentation
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
├── public
├── services
├── styles
├── types
└── utils
```

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the chatbot UI. The user interacts with the chatbot through the UI, triggering API calls to OpenAI and Google APIs. The responses are then processed and displayed in the chat interface. The flow of data from the user's input to the displayed response involves several parts of the codebase, including the 'pages', 'components', 'utils', and 'services' directories.

### System Connections

The chatbot UI interacts with external services, specifically OpenAI and Google APIs. The 'pages/api' directory contains files for handling these API requests and responses. The 'services' directory also plays a crucial role in managing these interactions, particularly the 'useApiService.ts' file, which defines a custom React hook for making API calls.

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows a robust testing strategy. The '__tests__' directory is dedicated to testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory serving as a testing suite. The 'importExports.test.ts' file in the 'utils/app' subdirectory validates the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version.
