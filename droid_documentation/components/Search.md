## `components/Search` Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the home for the Search component. This component is a functional React component written in TypeScript, designed to provide a search input field for the user interface. The Search component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string. This directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two main files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that exports a functional component named 'Search'. The component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the directory, exporting the default from 'Search.tsx'. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory.

### Key Components

The `components/Search` directory houses two key files:

- `Search.tsx`: This file is the heart of the Search component. It defines the functional component and its props, and it handles the rendering of the search input field and the 'X' icon. The 'onSearch' function is called when the value of the input field changes, and when the 'X' icon is clicked, the search input is cleared.

- `index.ts`: This file is crucial as it exports the default from 'Search.tsx', serving as the public interface for the directory. This allows other parts of the code to import the Search component easily.

### Usage & Examples

The Search component is used in the chatbot-ui project to provide a search input field in the user interface. It is a functional component that accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' prop is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' prop is the current search term, and the 'onSearch' prop is a function that updates the search term.

Here is a simplified example of how the Search component might be used:

```typescript
import Search from '../components/Search';

function App() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

  return (
    <Search
      placeholder="Search..."
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      onSearch={setSearchTerm}
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, the Search component is imported from the 'Search' directory. It is then used in the 'App' component, with the 'placeholder' prop set to "Search...", the 'searchTerm' prop set to the state variable 'searchTerm', and the 'onSearch' prop set to the state setter function 'setSearchTerm'. This allows the 'App' component to manage the state of the search term and to update it when the value of the search input field changes.
