# `components/Mobile2` Directory

The `components/Mobile2` directory is a specialized module within the larger `components` directory. It houses a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional React component named `Navbar`. This component is a critical part of the `Mobile2` module, serving as a navigation bar within the user interface of the chatbot application. The `Navbar` component is designed to display the name of a selected conversation and provide an interactive icon for initiating new conversations.

## Contents

The `components/Mobile2` directory contains only one file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines the `Navbar` functional component. The component is designed to render a navigation bar that displays the name of a selected conversation and an interactive icon for initiating new conversations.

## Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the sole occupant of the `components/Mobile2` directory and is therefore its key component. This file defines the `Navbar` functional component, which is a critical part of the `Mobile2` module. The `Navbar` component is designed to display the name of a selected conversation and provide an interactive icon for initiating new conversations.

## Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the `Mobile2` module to render a navigation bar in the chatbot user interface. It accepts two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`. The `selectedConversation` prop is of type `Conversation` and represents the currently selected conversation that the navigation bar displays. The `onNewConversation` prop is a function that is triggered when the user clicks on the `IconPlus` icon in the navigation bar, initiating a new conversation.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is the currently selected conversation, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that handles the creation of a new conversation when the `IconPlus` icon is clicked.
