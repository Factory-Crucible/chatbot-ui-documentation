## Services Directory

The `services` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. It houses two TypeScript files, `errorService.ts` and `useApiService.ts`, which define custom React hooks that are integral to the functionality of the chatbot UI. These hooks are responsible for handling API calls and managing error messages in a localized manner. The `services` directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Contents

The `services` directory contains the following TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named `useErrorService` that provides localized error messages using the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next`. The hook returns a function `getModelsError` that takes an error object and returns an `ErrorMessage` object with a title, status code, and list of messages. The title and messages are translated using the `useTranslation` hook.

- `useApiService.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useApiService` that uses another custom hook `useFetch` to make API calls. The hook provides a function `getModels` which makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint. The function accepts an object of type `GetModelsRequestProps` and an optional `AbortSignal` as parameters. The `GetModelsRequestProps` interface is also defined in this file.

### Key Components

The `services` directory contains two key TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: The `useErrorService` hook defined in this file is crucial for providing localized error messages. It uses the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next` to translate error messages, ensuring that users receive error messages in their preferred language. This enhances the user experience and makes the chatbot UI more accessible to users from different linguistic backgrounds.

- `useApiService.ts`: The `useApiService` hook defined in this file is responsible for making API calls. It uses the `useFetch` hook to make these calls, and provides a function `getModels` that makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint. This function is essential for fetching model data from the API, which is a key part of the chatbot UI's functionality.

### Usage & Examples

The `services` directory is used to manage API calls and error messages in the chatbot UI. The hooks defined in this directory are used throughout the codebase to fetch data from the API and provide localized error messages.

For example, the `useApiService` hook might be used in a component to fetch model data from the API. The component could call the `getModels` function with a `GetModelsRequestProps` object and an optional `AbortSignal`, and use the returned data to update its state.

Similarly, the `useErrorService` hook might be used in a component to provide localized error messages. If an error occurs while fetching data from the API, the component could call the `getModelsError` function with the error object, and use the returned `ErrorMessage` object to display an error message to the user.

Please note that these are hypothetical examples and may not represent the actual usage patterns in the codebase.
