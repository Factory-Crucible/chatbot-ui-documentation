## components/Chatbar

The `components/Chatbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It houses the primary interface for user interaction with the chatbot, providing a space for managing conversations, changing API keys, and handling plugin keys. The directory contains three TypeScript files and a subdirectory, each contributing to the functionality of the Chatbar component. The files define the initial state, the component itself, and the context for the Chatbar component. The subdirectory, `components/Chatbar/components`, contains additional components that handle settings, conversations, chat folders, and plugin keys.

### Contents

The `components/Chatbar` directory contains the following files and subdirectory:

- `Chatbar.state.tsx`: This TypeScript file sets the initial state for the Chatbar component, including a search term and a list of filtered conversations.
- `Chatbar.tsx`: This is a React component representing the chat bar, with handlers for various actions like changing API keys and managing conversations.
- `Chatbar.context.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines the context for the Chatbar component, including the state, dispatch function, and several handler functions.
- `components/Chatbar/components`: This subdirectory contains six TypeScript files, each exporting a React component used in the chatbot UI. These components handle settings, conversations, chat folders, and plugin keys.

### Key Components

The `Chatbar.tsx` file is a key component in this directory. It is a React component that represents the chat bar of the chatbot application. It defines several handlers for different actions such as changing API keys, handling plugin keys, exporting and importing data, clearing conversations, deleting conversations, and toggling the chat bar. These handlers interact with both local and global state, and also make use of local storage.

The `Chatbar.context.tsx` file is another critical component. It defines the context for the Chatbar component, including the state, dispatch function, and several handler functions for managing conversations, exporting and importing data, and handling changes to plugin keys and API keys. This context is crucial for managing state and actions within the Chatbar component.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `components/Chatbar` directory are used to manage the chat bar in the chatbot UI. The `Chatbar.state.tsx` file sets the initial state for the Chatbar component, which is then used in the `Chatbar.tsx` file to manage the state of the chat bar. The `Chatbar.context.tsx` file provides a context that is used in the `Chatbar.tsx` file and other components in the `components/Chatbar/components` subdirectory to manage state and actions.

For example, the `Chatbar.tsx` file uses the `ChatbarContext` from `Chatbar.context.tsx` to access the state and dispatch function. It then uses these to manage the state of the chat bar and handle various actions like changing API keys, managing conversations, and handling plugin keys.

The `components/Chatbar/components` subdirectory contains components that are used in the chat bar. For instance, the `ChatbarSettings.tsx` component provides a settings interface for the chat bar, with options to clear conversations, import/export data, and change API keys. The `Conversations.tsx` component displays a list of individual conversations not part of any folder.
