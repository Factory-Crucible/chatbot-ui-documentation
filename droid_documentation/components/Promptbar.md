## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. This directory is a part of the larger 'components' directory, which houses various parts of the project. The 'Promptbar' feature is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. This directory contains TypeScript files and a subdirectory, each playing a significant role in the functionality of the 'Promptbar' component.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory named 'components'. The TypeScript files include 'index.ts', 'PromptBar.context.tsx', 'Promptbar.tsx', and 'Promptbar.state.tsx'. The 'index.ts' file serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the component for use in other parts of the application. The 'PromptBar.context.tsx' file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. The 'Promptbar.tsx' file is the main component file, representing the sidebar in the user interface, with functions for managing prompts and folders. The 'Promptbar.state.tsx' file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.

The 'components' subdirectory contains related components, including 'Prompts.tsx', 'PromptbarSettings.tsx', 'Prompt.tsx', 'PromptModal.tsx', and 'PromptFolders.tsx'. Each of these files exports a component that contributes to the functionality of the 'Promptbar' feature.

### Key Components

The 'Promptbar.tsx' file is a key component in this directory. It represents the 'Promptbar' component, a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. This file uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects, and it imports several other components and contexts to handle actions like toggling the prompt bar, creating, deleting, and updating prompts.

The 'PromptBar.context.tsx' file is another critical component. It defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. This context is used in other parts of the application to manage the state and behavior of the 'Promptbar' component.

The 'Promptbar.state.tsx' file is also important as it defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component. This state is used in the 'Promptbar' component to initialize and manage its state.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders in the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to build and manage the 'Promptbar' feature of the chatbot-ui application. The 'Promptbar.tsx' file is the main component file, representing the sidebar in the user interface. It uses the 'PromptBar.context.tsx' and 'Promptbar.state.tsx' files to manage its state and behavior.

The 'components' subdirectory contains related components that contribute to the functionality of the 'Promptbar' feature. For example, the 'Prompts.tsx' file exports a 'Prompts' component that renders a list of prompts. The 'Prompt.tsx' file exports a 'PromptComponent' that handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts. The 'PromptModal.tsx' file exports a component that renders a modal for editing a prompt. The 'PromptFolders.tsx' file exports a component that handles the display and functionality of folders within the 'Promptbar'.

While the skeleton code provided does not fully represent the typical usage patterns, it gives a sense of how these files and components fit together to build the 'Promptbar' feature of the application.
