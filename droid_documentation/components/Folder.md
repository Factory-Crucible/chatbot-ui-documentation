## components/Folder

The `components/Folder` directory is a part of the `chatbot-ui` project's component architecture. It houses the `Folder` component, a critical piece of the user interface that represents a folder in a file system. This component is responsible for rendering a folder's visual representation, handling user interactions such as renaming and deleting the folder, and managing drag and drop events. The `Folder` component is a React component written in TypeScript and uses icons from the `@tabler/icons-react` package to enhance the user interface.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. The component represents a folder in a file system and includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed.

- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects to simplify imports from a directory.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Folder` component, defined in the `Folder.tsx` file. This component is crucial to the user interface of the `chatbot-ui` project, as it provides a visual representation of a folder in a file system and handles user interactions with the folder. The `Folder` component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used throughout the `chatbot-ui` project to represent folders in a file system. It is a versatile component that can be used in various parts of the application where a visual representation of a folder is needed.

For example, the `Folder` component might be used in a file explorer feature of the application. The component would be passed the current folder, a search term for filtering the displayed contents, a drop handler for managing drag and drop events, and a list of folder components representing the contents of the current folder. The component would then render a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It would also handle user interactions such as renaming and deleting the folder, and drag and drop events.

Please note that the above usage pattern is a general example and may not represent the exact usage in the `chatbot-ui` project. Always refer to the actual codebase for accurate usage patterns.
