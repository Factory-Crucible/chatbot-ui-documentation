## Public Directory

The `public` directory serves as a storage for static files that are not processed by the build pipeline. These files are directly accessible by the client-side and typically include assets like images, favicons, and other static resources. The directory contains a mix of files and a subdirectory named `screenshots`.

### Contents

The `public` directory houses three files: `screenshot.png`, `favicon.ico`, and `.DS_Store`. The `screenshot.png` and `favicon.ico` files are typically used for website branding, while `.DS_Store` is a system file created by macOS. The directory also contains a subdirectory named `screenshots`, dedicated to storing screenshot files.

- `public/favicon.ico`: This file is typically used as the icon that appears in the browser tab next to the website title.
- `public/.DS_Store`: This is a system file created by macOS, storing custom attributes of its containing folder.
- `public/screenshot.png`: This file is typically used for website branding or as a preview image.
- `public/screenshots`: This subdirectory is dedicated to storing screenshot files.

### Key Components

The `public` directory's key components are the `favicon.ico` and `screenshot.png` files. These files are directly accessible by the client-side and are typically used for website branding. The `favicon.ico` file is used as the icon that appears in the browser tab next to the website title, while the `screenshot.png` file can be used as a preview image or for other branding purposes.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `public` directory are used as static resources that are directly accessible by the client-side. For example, the `favicon.ico` file can be referenced in the HTML document's head section to set the website's favicon:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
```

Similarly, the `screenshot.png` file can be used in an HTML document to display an image:

```html
<img src="/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot" />
```

The `public/screenshots` subdirectory can be used to store and organize screenshot files, which can be accessed directly by the client-side.
