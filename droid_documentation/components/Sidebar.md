## components/Sidebar

The `components/Sidebar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It contains TypeScript files that define the Sidebar component and its functionalities. The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The directory also includes a 'components' subdirectory, which contains additional component files for managing the sidebar.

### Contents

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains several files and a subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point, exporting the main Sidebar component from 'Sidebar.tsx'.
- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `components`: This subdirectory contains additional component files for managing the sidebar, including 'OpenCloseButton.tsx', which exports two components responsible for opening and closing the sidebar.

### Key Components

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains several key components:

- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `OpenCloseButton.tsx`: This file, located in the 'components' subdirectory, exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are responsible for opening and closing the sidebar, respectively.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Sidebar` directory are used to manage the sidebar within the chatbot UI. 

For example, the `Sidebar.tsx` file defines a Sidebar component that takes a variety of props including flags for whether it's open, the side it should appear on, and handlers for various actions such as creating items and folders, and handling search terms. It also accepts components to render items, folders, and a footer. The Sidebar component itself is a functional component that conditionally renders different layouts based on whether it's open or not. It also handles drag and drop events.

The `SidebarButton.tsx` file defines a SidebarButton component that is designed to be used in a sidebar. The SidebarButton component accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. 'text' is a string that represents the button's label, 'icon' is a JSX.Element that represents the button's icon, and 'onClick' is a function that is executed when the button is clicked. The component returns a button element with specific styling and behavior. When the button is clicked, the 'onClick' function is triggered.

The `OpenCloseButton.tsx` file, located in the 'components' subdirectory, exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are used to open and close a sidebar in a user interface. Both components accept two props: 'onClick', a function that is triggered when the button is clicked, and 'side', a string that can be either 'left' or 'right', indicating the side of the screen where the sidebar is located. The 'CloseSidebarButton' component displays an arrow icon pointing towards the side of the screen where the sidebar is located, while the 'OpenSidebarButton' displays an arrow pointing away from the sidebar. The components also have different styles depending on the screen size.
