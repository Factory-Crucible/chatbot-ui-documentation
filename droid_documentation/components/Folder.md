## `components/Folder` Directory

The `components/Folder` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project. It houses the `Folder` component, a React component that represents a folder in a file system. This component is integral to the user interface of the chatbot, as it provides a visual representation of a folder and allows users to interact with it. The `Folder` component is responsible for rendering a button and an input field, and it includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The component uses icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package to enhance the user experience.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two main files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. The component represents a folder in a file system and includes several functionalities such as renaming, deleting, and drag and drop events.

- `index.ts`: This TypeScript file simplifies imports from this folder by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is a key component in this directory. It exports the `Folder` component, which is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui's user interface. The `Folder` component accepts several props, maintains state, and renders a button and an input field. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The component uses icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package to enhance the user experience.

The `index.ts` file, while not as complex as the `Folder.tsx` file, plays a vital role in simplifying imports from this directory. By exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file, it allows other files to import from `index.ts`, which will automatically forward the import to `Folder.tsx`.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the chatbot-ui project to represent a folder in a file system. It is a versatile component that can be used in various parts of the application where a visual representation of a folder is required. The component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Folder` component might be used:

```typescript
import Folder from './components/Folder';

const App = () => {
  const currentFolder = {...}; // some folder object
  const searchTerm = 'example';
  const handleDrop = (e, folder) => {...}; // some drop handler function
  const folderComponent = [<FolderComponent />, <FolderComponent />]; // some folder components

  return (
    <Folder
      currentFolder={currentFolder}
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      handleDrop={handleDrop}
      folderComponent={folderComponent}
    />
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, the `Folder` component is imported from the `index.ts` file in the `components/Folder` directory. It is then used in the `App` component, with the necessary props passed in.
