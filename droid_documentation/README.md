Welcome to the documentation for the `Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation` repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the repository, including its purpose, technologies used, major components, conventions, structure, main flows, and testing principles. This documentation is generated and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes by the Documentation Droid.

## Overview

### Purpose

The `Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation` repository is a Docker-based Node.js project that provides a user interface for a chatbot. The chatbot UI is designed to interact with various services, including OpenAI and Google APIs, to generate prompts and send responses. The repository is part of a larger system, interacting with other services to provide a comprehensive chatbot solution.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies. It is primarily built with TypeScript and ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The project also uses Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and Makefile for managing build tasks. For styling, it utilizes Tailwind CSS and PostCSS. The project also uses the `react-i18next` library for internationalization.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components. The `components` directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different aspect of the chatbot UI. The `pages` directory contains key files and an `api` subdirectory for handling API requests. The `utils` directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The `hooks` directory defines custom React hooks, and the `services` directory contains services for error handling and API calls.

### Conventions

The codebase follows certain conventions for better understanding and maintainability. File naming convention is consistent across the codebase, with TypeScript files using the `.ts` or `.tsx` extension and test files using the `.test.ts` extension. The project also follows a specific directory structure, with each directory serving a distinct purpose.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. Some directories contain a lot of code, while others contain static assets and are rarely utilized. The root directory of the project contains configuration files for the project, Docker, and various tools. It also includes a Dockerfile for creating a Docker image and a 'docker-compose.yml' for defining and managing the Docker application.

The `components` directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different aspect of the chatbot UI. The `pages` directory contains key files and an `api` subdirectory for handling API requests. The `utils` directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The `hooks` directory defines custom React hooks, and the `services` directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The `types` directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The `k8s` directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The `__tests__` directory is for testing, with a `utils` subdirectory as a testing suite.

The `tree` visual of the directory structure is as follows:

```
.
├── __tests__
├── components
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
├── public
├── services
├── styles
├── types
└── utils
```

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the chatbot UI's interaction with various services, including OpenAI and Google APIs, to generate prompts and send responses. The flow begins with the user interacting with the chatbot UI, which triggers API calls to the respective services. The responses from these services are then processed and displayed in the chatbot UI.

For a more in-depth understanding of the flow, refer to the [`pages.md`](./pages.md) and `api.md` documentation files. These files provide detailed information about the main entry points of the codebase and the handling of API requests and responses, respectively.

### System Connections

The system connections in the codebase primarily involve interactions with external services, such as OpenAI and Google APIs. The codebase includes specific components and utility functions for making API calls to these services and processing their responses. The `services` directory contains services for error handling and API calls, while the `utils` directory provides utility functions for various aspects of the project, including server-side operations and data standardization.

For a high-level description of how these services or components are placed in the codebase and how they interact, refer to the [`services.md`](./services.md) and [`utils.md`](./utils.md) documentation files.

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows certain testing principles to ensure the quality and reliability of the code. The `__tests__` directory is dedicated to testing, with a `utils` subdirectory serving as a testing suite. The tests validate various functionalities of the application, including import and export operations, utility functions, and API calls.

For a detailed overview of the testing principles and the structure of the tests, refer to the [`__tests__.md`](./__tests__.md) documentation file.
