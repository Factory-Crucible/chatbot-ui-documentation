## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project. It houses the `Promptbar` component, which is a sidebar in the user interface of the application. This component is responsible for managing prompts and folders, providing an interactive and user-friendly way to handle these elements. The `Promptbar` component is built using React and TypeScript, and it utilizes various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects. The directory also contains a subdirectory `components/Promptbar/components` which includes related components that enhance the functionality of the `Promptbar`.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory. The TypeScript files include `index.ts`, `PromptBar.context.tsx`, `Promptbar.tsx`, and `Promptbar.state.tsx`. The `index.ts` file serves as the entry point for the `Promptbar` component, exporting the component for use in other parts of the application. The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file defines the context for the `Promptbar` component, including state and handlers for prompts. The `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file, representing the sidebar in the user interface. The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file defines the initial state and interface for the `Promptbar` component.

The subdirectory `components/Promptbar/components` contains related components that enhance the functionality of the `Promptbar`. These include `Prompts.tsx`, `PromptbarSettings.tsx`, `Prompt.tsx`, `PromptModal.tsx`, and `PromptFolders.tsx`.

### Key Components

The `Promptbar.tsx` file is a key component in this directory. It represents the `Promptbar` component, a sidebar in the user interface of the application. This component is responsible for managing prompts and folders, providing an interactive and user-friendly way to handle these elements. The `Promptbar.tsx` file uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects, and it imports several other components to enhance its functionality.

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is another critical component. It defines the context for the `Promptbar` component, including state and handlers for prompts. This context is used throughout the `Promptbar` component and its related components, providing a way to manage and share state.

The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file is also important, as it defines the initial state and interface for the `Promptbar` component. This state is used in the `Promptbar` component and its related components, providing a consistent structure for managing the state of the `Promptbar`.

### Usage & Examples

The `Promptbar` component is used in the chatbot-ui project to provide a sidebar in the user interface. This sidebar is used to manage prompts and folders, providing an interactive and user-friendly way to handle these elements. The `Promptbar` component is built using React and TypeScript, and it utilizes various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects.

For example, the `Promptbar` component uses the `PromptbarContext` defined in the `PromptBar.context.tsx` file to manage and share state. This context includes state and handlers for prompts, which are used in the `Promptbar` component and its related components.

The `Promptbar` component also uses the initial state defined in the `Promptbar.state.tsx` file. This state provides a consistent structure for managing the state of the `Promptbar`, and it is used throughout the `Promptbar` component and its related components.

The related components in the `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory enhance the functionality of the `Promptbar`. For example, the `Prompts.tsx` component renders a list of prompts, the `Prompt.tsx` component manages prompts, and the `PromptFolders.tsx` component manages folders within the `Promptbar`.
