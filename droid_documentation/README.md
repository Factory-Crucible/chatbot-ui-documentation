Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the repository, including its purpose, technologies used, major components, conventions, structure, main flows, and testing principles. These docs are generated and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes by the Documentation Droid.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to provide a user interface for a chatbot. It is a Docker-based Node.js project that uses TypeScript and React. The repository is part of a larger system, interacting with other services such as OpenAI and Google APIs to generate prompts and send responses.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies. It uses Node.js as the runtime environment and TypeScript for static typing. The frontend is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The project also uses Docker for containerization, which simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across different environments. Other notable technologies include Kubernetes for orchestration, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Prettier for code formatting.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, each represented as a React component. The 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The '__tests__' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

### Conventions

The codebase follows several conventions. File names are descriptive and follow the camelCase naming convention. The project uses the '.tsx' extension for TypeScript files that contain JSX code, and the '.ts' extension for other TypeScript files. The '__tests__' directory is used for testing, and test files use the '.test.ts' extension. The 'types' directory is used for TypeScript type definitions, and the 'utils' directory is used for utility functions.

## Structure

The codebase is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. Some directories contain a lot of code, while others contain static assets and are rarely utilized. Here is a high-level overview of the structure:

- '.' (root directory)
- 'components'
- 'hooks'
- 'k8s'
- 'pages'
- 'public'
- 'services'
- 'styles'
- 'types'
- 'utils'
- '__tests__'

For a more detailed overview of each directory, please refer to the respective documentation files in the 'droid_documentation' directory.

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around handling chat conversations and managing settings. The 'Chat' component handles the chat functionality, while the 'Settings' component manages the settings dialog, import functionality, and API key settings. The 'Promptbar' component manages prompts and folders. The 'Sidebar' component handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state.

Data flows from the user interface to the backend services through API calls. For example, when a user sends a message, the 'Chat' component makes a POST request to the '/api/chat' endpoint. The server processes the request, interacts with the OpenAI service, and sends a response back to the 'Chat' component.

For a more in-depth understanding of the flow, please refer to the respective documentation files in the 'droid_documentation' directory.

### System Connections

The codebase interacts with external services such as OpenAI and Google APIs. The 'models.ts' file in the 'api' directory handles requests related to OpenAI models, while the 'google.ts' file handles API requests and responses, interacting with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API to generate prompts and send responses.

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows several testing principles. The '__tests__' directory is dedicated to testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory serving as a testing suite. The 'importExports.test.ts' file in the 'utils/app' subdirectory validates the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version and tests the 'cleanData' function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

For more information on testing, please refer to the ['__tests__.md'](./droid_documentation/__tests__.md) file in the 'droid_documentation' directory.
