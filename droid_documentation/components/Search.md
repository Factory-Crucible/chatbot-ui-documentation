## `components/Search` Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a part of the `components` directory, which houses various parts of the chatbot-ui project. This directory specifically contains the code for the 'Search' component of the chatbot user interface. The 'Search' component is a functional component that provides a search input field in the user interface. It accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' represents the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input when clicked. This directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two main files: `Search.tsx` and `index.ts`.

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that exports a functional component 'Search'. It takes in three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.

- `index.ts`: This is a simple TypeScript file that exports the default export from the sibling file 'Search.tsx'. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory. In this case, any other parts of the code that import from the 'Search' directory will automatically receive the default export from 'Search.tsx'.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the 'Search' component defined in the `Search.tsx` file. This component is crucial as it provides the search functionality in the chatbot user interface. It allows users to input a search term and updates this term when the input field value changes. It also provides a way to clear the search input with the 'X' icon. This component is exported as the default export from the `Search.tsx` file and is made available for import from other parts of the codebase through the `index.ts` file.

### Usage & Examples

The 'Search' component is used in the chatbot user interface to provide a search input field. It is imported from the 'Search' directory, which automatically provides the default export from the `Search.tsx` file due to the `index.ts` file.

The 'Search' component can be used in a parent component as follows:

```jsx
import Search from 'components/Search';

// ...

<Search
  placeholder="Search..."
  searchTerm={currentSearchTerm}
  onSearch={updateSearchTerm}
/>
```

In this example, `currentSearchTerm` is the current search term, and `updateSearchTerm` is a function that updates this term. The 'Search' component displays the `currentSearchTerm` in the input field and calls `updateSearchTerm` when the input field value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input by calling `updateSearchTerm` with an empty string.
