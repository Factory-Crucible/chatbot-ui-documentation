## **tests** Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in this project. It is a crucial part of the codebase, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the application's functionality. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within `utils`, there's another subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

### Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- `utils`: This subdirectory serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. It contains a subdirectory named `app`.
  
  - `app`: This subdirectory houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.
    
    - `importExports.test.ts`: This is a test file for utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It verifies different versions of the export format, ensuring that a given object matches the expected format for each version. The file also tests the 'cleanData' function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest one, and checks that the cleaned data aligns with the expected structure of the latest format.

### Key Components

The key component in the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file. This file tests the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the exported objects conform to the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one. This function is crucial for maintaining data consistency and compatibility across different versions of the application.

### Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used for testing the application's functionality. The `importExports.test.ts` file, for example, tests the import and export operations of the application. It does this by checking whether a given object matches the expected format for each version. The file also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest one. The tests ensure that the cleaned data matches the expected structure of the latest format.

Here is a simplified example of how the `importExports.test.ts` file might be structured:

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  // Test cases for export format functions
});

describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
  // Test cases for the cleanData function
});
```

This example is not representative of the actual code, but it gives an idea of how the file is structured and used.
