## components/Folder

The `components/Folder` directory is a part of the chatbot-ui project's component architecture, specifically designed to represent a folder in a file system within the user interface. This directory contains two main files: `Folder.tsx` and `index.ts`. The `Folder.tsx` file is a React component that encapsulates the functionality and presentation of a folder, while the `index.ts` file simplifies the import process from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file. This directory plays a crucial role in the project's file management system, providing an interactive and user-friendly way to navigate through the file system.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component that represents a folder in a file system. It accepts several props, maintains its own state, and renders a button and an input field. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The component uses icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package.
- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It exports a single component, `Folder`, which represents a folder in a file system. The component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. The component maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component renders a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The component uses several icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the chatbot-ui project to represent a folder in a file system. It is a key part of the project's file management system, providing an interactive and user-friendly way to navigate through the file system.

The `Folder` component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. The current folder prop is an object representing the current folder. The search term prop is a string used to filter the contents of the folder. The drop handler prop is a function that handles drag and drop events. The folder component prop is a list of React elements representing the contents of the folder.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Folder` component might be used:

```typescript
import Folder from './components/Folder';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const currentFolder = { /* folder data */ };
  const searchTerm = 'my search term';
  const handleDrop = (e, folder) => { /* handle drop event */ };
  const folderComponent = [ /* list of folder components */ ];

  return (
    <Folder
      currentFolder={currentFolder}
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      handleDrop={handleDrop}
      folderComponent={folderComponent}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example, `MyComponent` imports the `Folder` component and uses it to render a folder. The `Folder` component is passed several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components.
