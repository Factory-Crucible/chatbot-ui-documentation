# `pages` Directory

The `pages` directory is a fundamental part of the `chatbot-ui` project, serving as the home for key files and a subdirectory that are integral to the functioning of the application. This directory is responsible for defining the main entry point for the home page, setting up the HTML document structure, and initializing pages and libraries for the application. It also houses the `api` subdirectory, which contains files that handle API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs. The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory work together to provide the structure and functionality of the application's pages, making it a crucial part of the codebase.

## Contents

The `pages` directory contains three TypeScript files and one subdirectory:

- `index.tsx`: This file serves as the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.

- `api`: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

## Key Components

The `pages` directory contains several key components that contribute to the functionality of the `chatbot-ui` project:

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, which are crucial for rendering the home page.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, which are essential for the proper rendering and functionality of the application.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, making it a key part of the application's infrastructure.

- `api`: This subdirectory is responsible for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs. It contains several files that each handle different aspects of the API functionality, making it a critical part of the application.

## Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used to define the structure and functionality of the application's pages. For example, the `index.tsx` file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, which are used to render the home page of the application.

The `_document.tsx` file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, which are used to render the HTML document structure of the application.

The `_app.tsx` file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, which is used to provide multi-language support for the application.

The `api` subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs. These files are used to handle different aspects of the API functionality, such as fetching data from the OpenAI API, processing requests, encoding messages, and interacting with an OpenAI service.
