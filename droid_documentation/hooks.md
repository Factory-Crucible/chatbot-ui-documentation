# `hooks` Directory

The `hooks` directory is a specialized section of the codebase that houses custom React hooks. These hooks, defined in TypeScript, are designed to provide reusable stateful logic and HTTP request functionality that can be utilized across the project. The directory contains two files: `useCreateReducer.ts` and `useFetch.ts`. These files define the `useCreateReducer` and `useFetch` hooks respectively, each serving a unique purpose within the codebase.

## Contents

The `hooks` directory contains the following files:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook, `useCreateReducer`, which is designed to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. It also defines two TypeScript types, `FieldNames` and `ActionType`, which are used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.
- `useFetch.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook, `useFetch`, which is used for making HTTP requests. It defines two types, `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel`, to structure the request parameters. The hook provides methods for each HTTP verb and uses a helper function, `handleFetch`, to perform the actual fetch operation.

## Key Components

The `hooks` directory contains two key components:

- `useCreateReducer`: This hook is a critical part of the state management strategy within the codebase. It provides a way to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state, ensuring type safety and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors. The `FieldNames` and `ActionType` types defined in this file are integral to the functioning of the `useCreateReducer` hook, as they help manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.
- `useFetch`: This hook is a fundamental part of the HTTP request handling within the codebase. It provides a reusable way to make HTTP requests, with methods for each HTTP verb. The `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel` types defined in this file structure the request parameters, ensuring that requests are correctly formatted. The `handleFetch` helper function within `useFetch` is responsible for constructing the request and handling the response, including error handling.

## Usage & Examples

The hooks defined in this directory are used throughout the codebase to manage state and handle HTTP requests.

The `useCreateReducer` hook is used to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. For example, it might be used in a component that needs to manage complex state:

```typescript
import { useCreateReducer } from './hooks/useCreateReducer';

const initialState = { count: 0 };
const { state, dispatch } = useCreateReducer({ initialState });

// Dispatch an action to update the state
dispatch({ type: 'increment', payload: 1 });
```

The `useFetch` hook is used to make HTTP requests. For example, it might be used in a component that needs to fetch data from an API:

```typescript
import { useFetch } from './hooks/useFetch';

const { get } = useFetch();

// Fetch data from an API
const data = await get('/api/data');
```

These examples are illustrative and may not represent actual usage within the codebase. Always refer to the codebase for accurate usage patterns.
