## components/Settings

The `components/Settings` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses three TypeScript React component files that manage various settings of the chatbot application. These components are responsible for handling the settings dialog, import functionality, and API key settings. They work together to provide a seamless user experience, allowing users to change the application theme, import data, and manage API keys.

### Contents

The `components/Settings` directory contains the following files:

- `SettingDialog.tsx`: This file exports a functional component that manages a settings dialog. The dialog allows users to change the application theme and handles outside clicks to close the dialog.

- `Import.tsx`: This file provides an import functionality. It renders a file input and a button that triggers the file picker. It reads the selected file as text, parses it as JSON, and calls a function with the parsed data.

- `Key.tsx`: This file manages the API key settings. It maintains a local state for the key and a flag indicating if the key is being changed. It handles key press events, updates the key when 'Enter' is pressed, and focuses on the input field when the key is being changed. It renders either an input field for changing the key or a button to initiate the change, depending on the state.

### Key Components

The `components/Settings` directory contains several key components that play a significant role in the functionality of the chatbot application:

- `SettingDialog.tsx`: This component is responsible for managing the settings dialog of the application. It uses several hooks, including 'useContext', 'useEffect', 'useReducer', and 'useRef', and the 'useTranslation' hook from 'next-i18next' for internationalization. It fetches the current settings using the 'getSettings' utility function and allows the user to change the theme of the application. The new settings are saved using the 'saveSettings' utility function.

- `Import.tsx`: This component provides an import functionality for the application. It uses the 'next-i18next' library for internationalization and the '@tabler/icons-react' library for icons. The component accepts a prop 'onImport' which is a function that takes a parameter of type 'SupportedExportFormats'. When a file is selected, it reads the file as text and parses it as JSON, then calls the 'onImport' function with the parsed data.

- `Key.tsx`: This component manages the API key settings for the application. It maintains a local state for the API key and a boolean flag to indicate whether the key is being changed. The component handles key press events and updates the API key when the 'Enter' key is pressed. It also uses an effect to focus on the input field when the key is being changed.

### Usage & Examples

The components in the `components/Settings` directory are used to manage various settings of the chatbot application:

- `SettingDialog.tsx`: This component is used to manage the settings dialog of the application. It is used when the user wants to change the application theme. The 'open' prop determines whether the dialog is visible or not, and 'onClose' is a function that is called when the dialog needs to be closed.

- `Import.tsx`: This component is used to import data into the application. It is used when the user wants to import data from a file. The 'onImport' prop is a function that takes a parameter of type 'SupportedExportFormats' and is called with the parsed data from the selected file.

- `Key.tsx`: This component is used to manage the API key settings of the application. It is used when the user wants to change the API key. The 'apiKey' prop is the current API key, and 'onApiKeyChange' is a function that is called with the new key when the 'Enter' key is pressed.
