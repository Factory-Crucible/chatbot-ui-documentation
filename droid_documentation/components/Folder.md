## components/Folder Directory

The `components/Folder` directory is a dedicated space for the `Folder` component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a crucial part of the user interface, representing a folder in a file system. The `Folder` component is a React component written in TypeScript and is responsible for rendering a button and an input field, handling renaming and deleting of the folder, and managing drag and drop events. The component also maintains several pieces of state, including whether the folder is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether the folder is open or closed.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two main files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. The component accepts several props, maintains state, and renders a button and an input field. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The component uses icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package.
- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this folder by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

There are no subdirectories in this directory.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is a critical component in the `components/Folder` directory. It exports a single component, `Folder`, which represents a folder in a file system. The component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. The component maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component renders a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The component uses several icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the chatbot-ui project to represent a folder in a file system. It is a versatile component that can handle various tasks such as renaming and deleting the folder, managing drag and drop events, and maintaining the state of the folder.

For instance, the `Folder` component can be used in a scenario where the user wants to rename a folder. The component maintains a piece of state for the new name of the folder and provides an input field for the user to enter the new name. Once the user enters the new name and submits the form, the component handles the renaming of the folder.

Similarly, the `Folder` component can handle the deletion of a folder. The component maintains a piece of state for whether the folder is being deleted. When the user clicks the delete button, the component sets this state to true, and the folder is deleted.

The `Folder` component also handles drag and drop events. It accepts a drop handler prop, which is a function that is called when a draggable item is dropped onto the folder. This allows the user to move items between folders by dragging and dropping them.

The `Folder` component is a key part of the chatbot-ui project, providing a user-friendly interface for managing folders in a file system.
