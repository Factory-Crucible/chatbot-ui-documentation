## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. The 'Promptbar' is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. The directory contains TypeScript files and a subdirectory, each contributing to the overall functionality of the 'Promptbar' component.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the default export from the 'Promptbar.tsx' file.
- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.
- `components/Promptbar/components`: This subdirectory contains related components.

### Key Components

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several key files and components:

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This context file is crucial as it provides the state and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts, which are essential functionalities of the 'Promptbar' component.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI. It is responsible for managing prompts and folders, making it a central part of the 'Promptbar' functionality.
- `components/Promptbar/components`: This subdirectory contains several related components that contribute to the overall functionality of the 'Promptbar' component. These include 'Prompts.tsx', 'PromptbarSettings.tsx', 'Prompt.tsx', 'PromptModal.tsx', and 'PromptFolders.tsx'.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to provide the 'Promptbar' functionality within the chatbot-ui project. For instance, the 'PromptBar.context.tsx' file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. This context is then used in the 'Promptbar.tsx' file to manage prompts and folders.

The 'Promptbar.state.tsx' file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component. This state is then used in the 'Promptbar.tsx' file to manage the state of the 'Promptbar' component.

The 'components/Promptbar/components' subdirectory contains several related components. For example, 'Prompts.tsx' renders a list of prompts, 'Prompt.tsx' manages prompts, 'PromptModal.tsx' renders a modal for editing prompts, and 'PromptFolders.tsx' manages folders within the 'Promptbar'.

The 'Promptbar.tsx' file uses the 'PromptbarContext' to dispatch actions and handle updates and deletions of prompts. It also manages local state for showing a modal, deleting, renaming, and the rename value. The component handles drag events for the prompt and uses effects to manage the renaming and deleting states.
