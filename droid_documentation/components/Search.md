# `components/Search` Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, housing the code that powers the search functionality within the user interface. This directory contains two TypeScript files: `Search.tsx` and `index.ts`. The `Search.tsx` file defines a functional React component named 'Search', which is responsible for rendering the search input field and handling user interactions with it. The `index.ts` file serves as the public interface for the directory, exporting the default from `Search.tsx`.

## Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains the following files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that defines the 'Search' component. This component is responsible for rendering the search input field and handling user interactions with it.
- `index.ts`: This is a simple TypeScript file that exports the default export from the `Search.tsx` file. This file serves as the public interface for the `components/Search` directory.

## Key Components

The key component in this directory is the 'Search' component defined in the `Search.tsx` file. This component is a functional React component that accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.

## Usage & Examples

The 'Search' component is used within the chatbot-ui project to provide search functionality. It is a reusable component that can be used wherever a search input field is needed. The component is used by passing the required props to it. For example, it can be used as follows:

```typescript
<Search
  placeholder="Search for a chat..."
  searchTerm={currentSearchTerm}
  onSearch={updateSearchTerm}
/>
```

In this example, `currentSearchTerm` is a state variable that holds the current search term, and `updateSearchTerm` is a function that updates this state variable. The 'Search' component displays the current search term in the input field and calls the `updateSearchTerm` function when the user changes the input field's value or clicks the 'X' icon.
