## `components/Search` Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses the `Search` component, a functional React component written in TypeScript, which is responsible for the search functionality within the chatbot user interface. The `Search` component is a reusable piece of the UI that accepts user input and triggers search operations based on the input. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable, accepting props that define its behavior and appearance.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory is composed of two main files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that exports a functional component named `Search`. The `Search` component accepts three props: `placeholder`, `searchTerm`, and `onSearch`. The `placeholder` is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The `searchTerm` is the current search term, and `onSearch` is a function that updates the search term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the `searchTerm` and calls `onSearch` when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling `onSearch` with an empty string.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the `Search` directory. It exports the default export from the `Search.tsx` file. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Search` component, defined in the `Search.tsx` file. This component is a critical part of the chatbot user interface, providing the functionality for users to search within the application. It is designed to be reusable and adaptable, with its behavior and appearance controlled by the props it receives.

### Usage & Examples

The `Search` component is used in various parts of the application where search functionality is required. It is a reusable component that can be imported and used in any other component or page. The `placeholder`, `searchTerm`, and `onSearch` props allow for customization of the component's behavior and appearance.

For example, the `Search` component could be used in a page like this:

```jsx
import Search from '../components/Search';

function HomePage() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

  const handleSearch = (term) => {
    setSearchTerm(term);
    // Perform search operation...
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <Search
        placeholder="Search..."
        searchTerm={searchTerm}
        onSearch={handleSearch}
      />
      {/* Other components... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `Search` component is used in the `HomePage` component. The `searchTerm` state and `handleSearch` function are defined in the `HomePage` component and passed as props to the `Search` component. The `Search` component displays the current `searchTerm` in its input field and calls `handleSearch` when the input value changes, allowing the `HomePage` component to react to user input and perform search operations.
