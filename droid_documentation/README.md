Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the repository, its purpose, the technologies used, major components, conventions, structure, main flows, and testing principles. These docs are generated and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes by the Documentation Droid.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is a Docker-based Node.js project named 'chatbot-ui'. It is designed to provide a user interface for a chatbot application. The repository is a part of a larger system and interacts with other services, such as OpenAI and Google APIs, to provide a comprehensive chatbot experience.

### Technologies used

The project heavily relies on several leading technologies. It uses Node.js as the runtime environment and TypeScript for static typing. The frontend is built using ReactJS, and the styling is managed by Tailwind CSS. The project also uses Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. For state management and side effects, it uses custom React hooks. The project also interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different aspect of the chatbot UI. The 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The '**tests**' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

### Conventions

The codebase follows several conventions. File naming follows the pattern of using lowercase letters and separating words with periods, such as 'chat.ts' or 'errorService.ts'. The project uses '.tsx' for React components and '.ts' for other TypeScript files. The '**tests**' directory is used for testing, and test files are named with the pattern '[filename].test.ts'. The 'index.ts' files serve as entry points for their respective directories.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. Some directories contain a lot of code, while others contain static assets and are rarely utilized. Here is a high-level overview of the directory structure:

```
.
├── __tests__
├── components
├── droid_documentation
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
├── public
├── services
├── styles
├── types
└── utils
```

For a more detailed overview of each directory, please refer to the respective markdown files in the [`droid_documentation`](README.md) directory.

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the chatbot UI. The 'Chat' component handles the chat functionality, while the 'Chatbar' component manages the chat bar and its context. The 'Promptbar' component manages prompts and folders. The 'Settings' component manages the settings dialog, import functionality, and API key settings. The 'Sidebar' component handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. The 'Search' component provides search functionality. The 'Mobile' component provides a navigation bar for the mobile application.

For a more in-depth understanding of these flows, please refer to the respective markdown files in the [`droid_documentation`](README.md) directory.

### System Connections

The system interacts with external services like OpenAI and Google APIs. The 'api' directory in 'pages' contains files for handling these API requests and responses. The 'useApiService.ts' in 'services' directory uses 'useFetch' to make API calls. The 'models.ts' in 'api' directory handles requests related to OpenAI models.

## Testing Principles

The testing principles of the codebase are defined in the '**tests**' directory. The 'utils' subdirectory serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. The 'importExports.test.ts' file validates the functionality of import and export operations. It ensures that exported objects align with the expected format for each version and tests the 'cleanData' function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

For more details on testing, please refer to the [`__tests__.md`](__tests__.md) file.
