## Styles Directory

The `styles` directory is a dedicated space for managing the global styles of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation project. It plays a crucial role in defining the visual aesthetics of the chatbot user interface. The directory contains a single file, `globals.css`, which holds the global styles for the project. This file is responsible for importing base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework and defining custom styles for the project. The styles defined in this directory are applied across the entire project, ensuring a consistent look and feel.

### Contents

The `styles` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing only one file:

- `globals.css`: This is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file that contains global styles for the project. It includes the import of base, components, and utilities from Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The file also contains custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, including its track, thumb, and corner, with different styles for hover states. It sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade. Additionally, it contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Lastly, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `globals.css` file. This file is critical because it defines the global styles that are applied throughout the project. It imports the base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework, which provides a wide range of pre-defined styles that can be used throughout the project. The file also defines custom styles for the webkit scrollbar and the HTML document's background color. It includes a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, ensuring the user interface remains responsive and visually appealing on smaller screens. It also removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock', ensuring the correct display of these elements.

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file in the `styles` directory is used to define the global styles for the project. These styles are applied across the entire project, ensuring a consistent look and feel. The file is written in CSS, a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.

For example, the file imports the base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework. This allows the project to use the wide range of pre-defined styles provided by Tailwind CSS. The file also defines custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, including its track, thumb, and corner, with different styles for hover states.

The file also includes a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px. This ensures that the user interface remains responsive and visually appealing on smaller screens. For example, the width of 'pre' elements is adjusted under this condition.

Lastly, the file removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'. This ensures that these elements are displayed correctly, without any unnecessary padding.
