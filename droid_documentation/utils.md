## Utils Directory

The `utils` directory is a crucial part of the codebase, serving as a repository for utility files and subdirectories that support various aspects of the project. These utilities manage a wide range of tasks, from saving folders to local storage, mapping programming languages to file extensions, managing chat conversations, and handling the import and export of chatbot data. The directory is divided into three subdirectories: `app`, `server`, and `data`, each focusing on a specific aspect of the project.

### Contents

The `utils` directory is structured into three subdirectories: `app`, `server`, and `data`. Each subdirectory contains utility files that are specific to their respective areas of the project. The `app` subdirectory houses utility files for the chatbot UI project, the `server` subdirectory provides utility functions for server-side operations, and the `data` subdirectory contains a function that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed. The directory also contains a `.DS_Store` file, the purpose of which is not described.

### Key Components

Several key components are found within the `utils` directory. In the `app` subdirectory, the `const.ts` file defines several constants used throughout the application, primarily related to the configuration of the OpenAI API and some default settings for the chatbot. The `folders.ts` file manages saving folders to local storage, and the `settings.ts` file manages application settings and interacts with local storage. The `conversation.ts` file provides functions for managing chat conversations, and the `importExport.ts` file handles the import and export of chatbot data.

In the `server` subdirectory, the `index.ts` file provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and an 'OpenAIStream' function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API. The `google.ts` file contains a 'cleanSourceText' function that standardizes text data.

In the `data` subdirectory, the `throttle.ts` file defines a function that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed.

### Usage & Examples

The utility files in the `utils` directory are used throughout the codebase to perform various tasks. For instance, the `const.ts` file in the `app` subdirectory defines several constants that are used in the configuration of the OpenAI API and the chatbot's default settings. An example of a constant defined in this file is `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, which is either fetched from the environment variables or set to a default value.

The `folders.ts` file in the `app` subdirectory contains a function named 'saveFolders' that saves an array of folders to the local storage. The folders are expected to adhere to the 'FolderInterface' structure.

The `settings.ts` file in the `app` subdirectory manages application settings. It contains two functions: 'getSettings' and 'saveSettings'. The 'getSettings' function retrieves the settings from local storage, parses them, and returns them. If there are no settings in the local storage, it returns a default settings object with a 'theme' property set to 'dark'. The 'saveSettings' function takes a 'Settings' object as a parameter and stores it in the local storage.

The `index.ts` file in the `server` subdirectory provides utility functions for server-side operations. It exports an asynchronous function 'OpenAIStream' that constructs a URL based on certain conditions, makes a POST request to the OpenAI API, and returns a ReadableStream.

The `throttle.ts` file in the `data` subdirectory defines a function that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed. This function is likely used to prevent excessive calls to certain functions, such as API calls, that could potentially lead to performance issues or exceed rate limits.
