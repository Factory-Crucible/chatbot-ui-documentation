# `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project, each in its own subdirectory. The `components/Mobile` directory is specifically designed to cater to the mobile interface of the application, providing a seamless user experience across different devices. The directory currently contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component named 'Navbar' for the mobile application's navigation bar.

## Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is relatively simple in its structure, containing only one file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines a functional component named 'Navbar' for the mobile application's navigation bar. The component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of a chat application. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation', which is an object of type 'Conversation', and 'onNewConversation', which is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button that, when clicked, triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

## Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the 'Navbar' functional component, which is a critical part of the mobile application's user interface. The 'Navbar' component is designed to provide a user-friendly navigation bar for the chat application. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The 'selectedConversation' prop represents the currently active chat, while the 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the 'onNewConversation' function, allowing users to easily start new conversations.

## Usage & Examples

The 'Navbar' component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a functional component that is designed to be used in the navigation bar of the chat application. The component accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. 

Here is a simplified example of how the 'Navbar' component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar 
  selectedConversation={currentConversation} 
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation} 
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The 'Navbar' component displays the name of the `currentConversation` and an 'IconPlus' button. When the 'IconPlus' button is clicked, it triggers the `handleNewConversation` function, initiating a new conversation.
