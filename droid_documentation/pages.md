## Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a vital part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the home for key files and subdirectories that define the structure and behavior of the application's pages. This directory is a unique feature of Next.js applications, where the file-based routing system automatically maps files in this directory to routes based on their names and locations. The `pages` directory contains the main entry point for the home page (`index.tsx`), custom Document (`_document.tsx`), and App (`_app.tsx`) components for the Next.js application, and an `api` subdirectory for handling API requests and responses.

### Contents

The `pages` directory contains three TypeScript files and one subdirectory:

- `index.tsx`: Serves as the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function for the home page.

- `_document.tsx`: Defines a custom Document for the Next.js application, providing an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.

- `_app.tsx`: Initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.

- `api`: A subdirectory that contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

The `pages` directory houses several key components that are integral to the functioning of the chatbot-ui application:

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function for the home page, which are imported from a sibling file in the 'api' subdirectory named 'home'.

- `_document.tsx`: This file defines a custom Document for the Next.js application. It provides an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

- `_app.tsx`: This file initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, making the application accessible to a global audience.

- `api` subdirectory: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application. It includes 'models.ts' for handling requests related to OpenAI models, 'chat.ts' for chat functionality, and 'google.ts' for interacting with the Google Custom Search API and the OpenAI API.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used to define the structure and behavior of the application's pages. For instance, the `index.tsx` file serves as the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function for the home page, which are imported from a sibling file in the 'api' subdirectory named 'home'. 

The `_document.tsx` file defines a custom Document for the Next.js application. It provides an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization. This file is crucial for defining the overall HTML structure of the application and including global CSS.

The `_app.tsx` file initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, making the application accessible to a global audience. This file is essential for initializing global libraries and setting up the application's pages.

The `api` subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application. These files are used to define the behavior of the application's API endpoints and handle interactions with external APIs.
