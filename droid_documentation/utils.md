# `utils` Directory

The `utils` directory is a central location for utility files and subdirectories that provide various functionalities to the chatbot UI project. These utilities range from managing chat conversations, saving folders to local storage, mapping programming languages to file extensions, to handling the import and export of chatbot data. The directory is divided into three subdirectories: `app`, `server`, and `data`, each serving a specific purpose and housing related utility files.

## Contents

The `utils` directory contains three subdirectories and a file:

- `app`: This subdirectory contains utility files for the chatbot UI project. It includes files for managing folders, settings, prompts, conversations, and the import and export of chatbot data. It also contains a file for determining the appropriate API endpoint based on the provided plugin and a file for mapping programming languages to file extensions.
- `server`: This subdirectory provides utility functions for server-side operations. It includes a file that defines an 'OpenAIError' class and a function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API. It also contains a file that standardizes text data.
- `data`: This subdirectory contains a file that defines a 'throttle' function to control the rate at which a given function can be executed.
- `.DS_Store`: This file has no available description.

## Key Components

- `app/const.ts`: This file defines several constants used throughout the application, primarily related to the configuration of the OpenAI API and some default settings for the chatbot.
- `app/folders.ts`: This file manages saving folders to local storage.
- `app/settings.ts`: This file manages application settings and interacts with local storage.
- `app/api.ts`: This file determines the appropriate API endpoint based on the provided plugin.
- `server/index.ts`: This file provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and an 'OpenAIStream' function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API.
- `data/throttle.ts`: This file defines a 'throttle' function to control the rate at which a given function can be executed.

## Usage & Examples

The utility files in the `utils` directory are used throughout the codebase to provide various functionalities. For instance, the `app/folders.ts` file is used to manage saving folders to local storage. It contains a function `saveFolders` that takes an array of folders and saves them to local storage.

```typescript
export const saveFolders = (folders: FolderInterface[]) => {};
```

The `app/settings.ts` file manages application settings and interacts with local storage. It contains two functions: `getSettings` and `saveSettings`. The `getSettings` function retrieves the settings from local storage, parses them, and returns them. The `saveSettings` function takes a 'Settings' object as a parameter and stores it in the local storage.

```typescript
export const getSettings = (): Settings => {};
export const saveSettings = (settings: Settings) => {};
```

The `server/index.ts` file provides utility functions for server-side operations. It exports an asynchronous function `OpenAIStream` that constructs a URL based on certain conditions, makes a POST request to the OpenAI API, and returns a ReadableStream.

```typescript
export const OpenAIStream = async (model: OpenAIModel, systemPrompt: string, temperature : number, key: string, messages: Message[]);
```

The `data/throttle.ts` file defines a 'throttle' function to control the rate at which a given function can be executed. This function is a generic function that accepts a function and a limit as parameters.

```typescript
export function throttle<T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(func: T, limit: number): T;
```
