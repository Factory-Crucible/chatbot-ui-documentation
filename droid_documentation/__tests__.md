## __tests__ Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the `chatbot-ui` project. It is a crucial part of the codebase, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the code. The directory is structured to mirror the main codebase, allowing for a clear and organized testing structure. It contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within `utils`, there's another subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

### Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains one subdirectory: `utils`. This subdirectory is a testing suite for the utility functions within the application. It contains a further subdirectory named `app`, which houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.

### Key Components

The key component in the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file located in the `__tests__/utils/app` subdirectory. This file tests the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the exported objects align with the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one. These tests are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the data flow in the application.

### Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house all the tests for the `chatbot-ui` project. The tests are organized in a way that mirrors the structure of the main codebase, making it easier to locate and understand the tests for a particular part of the application.

For example, the `importExports.test.ts` file in the `__tests__/utils/app` subdirectory contains tests for the import and export operations of the application. These tests ensure that the exported objects conform to the expected format for each version and that the `cleanData` function correctly updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

Here is a simplified example of what the tests in `importExports.test.ts` might look like:

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {
    it('should return true for v1 format', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
    it('should return false for non-v1 formats', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
  });

  describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
    describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {
      it('should return the latest format', () => {
        // Test code here
      });
    });
  });
});
```

This example shows how the tests are structured, with each test case clearly described and grouped with related tests. This structure makes it easy to understand what each test is doing and why it is important.
