# Hooks Directory Documentation

The `hooks` directory is a specialized section of the codebase that houses custom React hooks. These hooks are designed to provide reusable logic that can be shared across multiple components. The hooks in this directory are written in TypeScript, which provides static typing to ensure type safety and improve code readability and maintainability. The directory contains two files, `useCreateReducer.ts` and `useFetch.ts`, each defining a specific hook that serves a unique purpose within the codebase.

## Contents

The `hooks` directory contains the following files:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This TypeScript file defines a custom React hook named `useCreateReducer`. This hook is designed to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. It also defines two TypeScript types: `FieldNames` and `ActionType` which are used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.
- `useFetch.ts`: This TypeScript file exports a custom React hook for making HTTP requests named `useFetch`. It defines two types, `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel`, to structure the request parameters. The `useFetch` hook returns an object with methods for each HTTP verb (get, post, put, patch, delete). Each method uses a helper function `handleFetch` to perform the actual fetch operation.

## Key Components

The `hooks` directory contains two key components:

- `useCreateReducer`: This custom hook is a critical part of the state management system within the codebase. It provides a way to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state, which helps to ensure type safety and improve code readability and maintainability. The `FieldNames` and `ActionType` types defined in this file are used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action, providing a clear and consistent interface for state management.
- `useFetch`: This custom hook is a fundamental part of the HTTP request handling system within the codebase. It provides a way to make HTTP requests with structured request parameters, and includes methods for each HTTP verb. The `handleFetch` helper function within this hook takes care of constructing the request and handling the response, including error handling. This makes it a crucial part of the codebase's interaction with external APIs and services.

## Usage & Examples

The hooks defined in this directory are used throughout the codebase to provide reusable logic for state management and HTTP request handling.

- `useCreateReducer`: This hook is used when a component needs to manage a complex state that would benefit from the use of a reducer. The hook takes an object with an `initialState` property as an argument, and returns a `dispatch` function and the current state. The `dispatch` function can be used to update the state based on the action type and payload.
- `useFetch`: This hook is used when a component needs to make HTTP requests. The hook returns an object with methods for each HTTP verb. These methods can be used to make requests with structured parameters, and handle the response in a consistent way. The `handleFetch` helper function within this hook takes care of constructing the request and handling the response, including error handling.

Please note that the above usage patterns are typical, but the actual usage of these hooks may vary based on the specific requirements of the components that use them.
