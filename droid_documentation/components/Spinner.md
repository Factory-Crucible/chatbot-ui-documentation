## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a crucial part of the user interface, providing a visual indication of loading states within the application. The Spinner component is a React component that displays a spinning animation, typically used when the application is processing data or waiting for a response from an API request. The directory contains two TypeScript files: `Spinner.tsx` and `index.ts`.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. It accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop controls the dimensions of the spinner, while the 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner. The spinner is created using SVG and includes an animation for the spinning effect.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component, exporting the default export from `Spinner.tsx`. This setup simplifies imports elsewhere in the project, as the Spinner component can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` without specifying the `Spinner.tsx` file.

The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the Spinner component, defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file. This component is a critical part of the user interface, providing a visual indication of loading states within the application. The Spinner component is designed to be flexible and reusable, accepting optional props to control its size and additional CSS classes.

The `index.ts` file is also a key part of this directory, serving as an entry point for the Spinner component. This setup simplifies the import process elsewhere in the project, allowing the Spinner component to be imported directly from `components/Spinner` without specifying the `Spinner.tsx` file.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate loading states. It can be used in any part of the application where a loading state needs to be indicated, such as during API requests or data processing.

For example, the Spinner component might be used in a component that fetches data from an API. While the data is being fetched, the Spinner component could be displayed to the user. Once the data has been fetched and is ready to be displayed, the Spinner component could be replaced with the data.

Here is a simplified example of how the Spinner component might be used:

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

function DataFetchingComponent() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData().then((fetchedData) => {
      setData(fetchedData);
      setIsLoading(false);
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? <Spinner /> : <DataDisplay data={data} />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the Spinner component is displayed while the data is being fetched. Once the data has been fetched, the Spinner component is replaced with a DataDisplay component that displays the fetched data.
