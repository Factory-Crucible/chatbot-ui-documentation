## components/Mobile Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project, each responsible for a specific part of the user interface and functionality of the chatbot. The `components/Mobile` directory specifically contains files related to the mobile version of the application, focusing on the navigation bar functionality in the mobile chat application.

### Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is a simple structure with a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`. This file defines a functional component named 'Navbar' that is specifically designed for the mobile application's navigation bar. The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines a functional component named 'Navbar' for the mobile application. The component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of a chat application. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation', which is an object of type 'Conversation', and 'onNewConversation', which is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button that, when clicked, triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Navbar` component defined in the `Navbar.tsx` file. This component is critical to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application as it provides the navigation bar functionality. The `Navbar` component accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The 'selectedConversation' prop represents the currently active chat, while the 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated. This component is a clear example of the project's modular design, where each component is responsible for a specific part of the user interface and functionality.

### Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a functional component that is designed to be used in the navigation bar of a chat application. The component accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The 'selectedConversation' prop is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat. The 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that handles the initiation of a new conversation. When the 'IconPlus' button within the `Navbar` component is clicked, it triggers the `handleNewConversation` function.
