## `components/Search` Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a crucial part of the `chatbot-ui` project, serving as the home for the `Search` component. This component is responsible for providing a user-friendly interface for searching within the application. It is designed to accept and manage user input, allowing users to enter search terms and clear the search field as needed. The `Search` component is a functional component written in TypeScript and React, and it is exported from this directory via the `index.ts` file.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two primary files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is the main file of the directory, containing the `Search` component. The component is a functional React component written in TypeScript. It accepts three props: `placeholder`, `searchTerm`, and `onSearch`. The `placeholder` prop is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The `searchTerm` prop represents the current search term, and `onSearch` is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the `searchTerm` and calls `onSearch` when its value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input when clicked.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the `Search` directory. It exports the default export from the `Search.tsx` file. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory.

### Key Components

The `Search.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the `Search` component, which is a functional React component that provides the search functionality within the application. The `Search` component accepts three props: `placeholder`, `searchTerm`, and `onSearch`. These props allow the component to display a placeholder when the search input is empty, manage the current search term, and update the search term when the user enters input or clears the input field.

### Usage & Examples

The `Search` component is used within the application to provide a user-friendly interface for searching. It is typically used in conjunction with other components that require search functionality. For example, it might be used on a page that displays a list of items, allowing the user to filter the list based on their search term.

The `Search` component is used by passing the required props to it. Here is a simplified example of how it might be used:

```typescript
<Search
  placeholder="Search..."
  searchTerm={this.state.searchTerm}
  onSearch={this.handleSearch}
/>
```

In this example, `this.state.searchTerm` represents the current search term, and `this.handleSearch` is a method that updates the search term based on user input. The `placeholder` prop is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty.
