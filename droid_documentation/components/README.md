# Directory Overview: components

The `components` directory is a central part of the `chatbot-ui` project, housing the various React components that make up the user interface of the chatbot. Each subdirectory within `components` corresponds to a specific part of the chatbot UI, encapsulating the logic and structure for that part. The components are written in TypeScript and make extensive use of React hooks and contexts for state management and side effects. They are designed to be modular and reusable, contributing to the overall functionality, scalability, and reliability of the chatbot UI.

## Contents

The `components` directory is a collection of subdirectories, each representing a specific part of the chatbot UI. These include `Sidebar`, `Settings`, `Buttons`, `Chatbar`, `Chat`, `Markdown`, `Folder`, `Spinner`, `Promptbar`, `Search`, and `Mobile`. Each subdirectory contains TypeScript files defining one or more React components, along with any associated logic and styles.

For instance, the `Markdown` subdirectory is dedicated to handling markdown rendering within the chatbot UI. It contains two TypeScript component files, `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx` and `CodeBlock.tsx`, which are responsible for rendering markdown content and displaying code blocks in markdown format respectively.

On the other hand, the `Buttons` subdirectory is dedicated to the definition and management of button components used across the user interface of the chatbot. The button components defined in this directory are designed to be reusable, encapsulating specific styling and functionality that can be leveraged in different parts of the application.

## Structure

The `components` directory is structured into several subdirectories, each serving a specific purpose. Here is a high-level overview of the directory's structure:

- [`Sidebar`](Sidebar.md): Contains the logic and structure for the sidebar component of the chatbot UI.
- [`Settings`](Settings.md): Houses three TypeScript React component files that manage the settings of the application.
- [`Buttons`](Buttons.md): Dedicated to the definition and management of button components used across the user interface of the chatbot.
- [`Chatbar`](Chatbar.md): Houses the `Chatbar` component, which is a sidebar in the user interface of the application.
- [`Chat`](Chat.md): Serves as the hub for the chat functionality of the application.
- [`Markdown`](Markdown.md): Dedicated to handling markdown rendering within the chatbot UI.
- [`Folder`](Folder.md): Represents a folder in a file system within the user interface.
- [`Spinner`](Spinner.md): Contains the `Spinner` component, a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface.
- [`Promptbar`](Promptbar.md): Houses the `Promptbar` component, which is a sidebar in the user interface of the application.
- [`Search`](Search.md): Contains the `Search` component, responsible for providing a search functionality within the user interface of the chatbot.
- [`Mobile`](Mobile.md): Contains the `Navbar` component, specifically designed for the mobile application's navigation bar.
