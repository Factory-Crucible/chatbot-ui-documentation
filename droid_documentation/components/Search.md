## components/Search Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository, specifically dedicated to the search functionality within the chatbot user interface. This directory contains the TypeScript React component that renders the search input field and manages the search functionality. The search component is a critical part of the user interface, enabling users to search through the chatbot's responses and their own queries. It is designed to be highly responsive, updating the search term as the user types and providing an option to clear the search input.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that exports a functional component named 'Search'. The component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' represents the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input when clicked.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the directory, exporting the default from 'Search.tsx'. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Search.tsx` file. This file contains the `Search` functional component that is responsible for rendering the search input field and managing the search functionality. The component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' prop is used to display a placeholder text when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' prop represents the current search term, and the 'onSearch' prop is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.

### Usage & Examples

The `Search` component is used within the chatbot user interface to provide search functionality. It is typically used in the header or sidebar of the application, allowing users to search through the chatbot's responses and their own queries.

The component is used by passing the required props to it. For example, it might be used like this:

```jsx
<Search
  placeholder="Search..."
  searchTerm={currentSearchTerm}
  onSearch={updateSearchTerm}
/>
```

In this example, `currentSearchTerm` is a state variable that holds the current search term, and `updateSearchTerm` is a function that updates this state variable. The `placeholder` prop is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty.
