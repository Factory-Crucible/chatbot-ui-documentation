## Services Directory

The `services` directory plays a crucial role in the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses two TypeScript files that define custom React hooks, `useErrorService` and `useApiService`, which are integral to the application's error handling and API interaction respectively. These hooks encapsulate complex functionalities, providing a clean and reusable interface for other parts of the application to leverage.

### Contents

The `services` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named `useErrorService` that provides localized error messages. It returns a function `getModelsError` that takes an error object and returns an `ErrorMessage` object with a title, status code, and list of messages.

- `useApiService.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useApiService` that uses `useFetch` to make API calls. It provides a function `getModels` that makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint. The function accepts an object of type `GetModelsRequestProps` and an optional `AbortSignal`.

### Key Components

The `services` directory contains two key TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: The `useErrorService` hook in this file is a critical component in the application's error handling strategy. It provides localized error messages, enhancing the user experience by delivering error information in a user-friendly and understandable manner.

- `useApiService.ts`: The `useApiService` hook in this file is a central part of the application's interaction with the API. It provides a `getModels` function that makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint, encapsulating the complexity of API interaction within a reusable hook.

### Usage & Examples

The `services` directory is used to encapsulate complex functionalities within reusable hooks, which are then used throughout the application.

- `useErrorService`: This hook is used whenever an error message needs to be displayed to the user. For example, if an API call fails, the `getModelsError` function can be used to generate a localized error message.

- `useApiService`: This hook is used to interact with the API. For example, when the application needs to fetch models from the API, it can use the `getModels` function provided by this hook.

Please note that the code snippets provided in the `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE` are not representative of typical usage patterns. They are skeleton code snippets meant to give an idea of the structure and functionality of the hooks defined in the `services` directory.
