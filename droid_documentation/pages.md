## Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a central component of the project, housing key files and a subdirectory that together form the backbone of the application's functionality. This directory is responsible for defining the main entry points of the application, setting up the custom Document and App components for the Next.js application, and managing the API interactions. The files within this directory work in tandem to create a cohesive user experience, from rendering the home page to handling API requests and responses.

### Contents

The `pages` directory contains three TypeScript files and a subdirectory named `api`. 

- `index.tsx`: This file serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory.

- `_document.tsx`: This is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

- `_app.tsx`: This is a custom App component for initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications, queries, and internationalization.

- `api`: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

The `pages` directory contains several critical files that play a significant role in the application's functionality.

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page, exporting a React component and a server-side rendering function. It plays a crucial role in rendering the home page of the application.

- `_document.tsx`: This custom Document for the Next.js application defines the HTML document structure, including metadata and scripts. It is essential for setting up the HTML structure of the application and including necessary scripts and metadata.

- `_app.tsx`: This custom App component initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications, queries, and internationalization. It is vital for initializing the application and setting up necessary libraries.

### Usage & Examples

The files within the `pages` directory are used to define the main structure and functionality of the application.

- `index.tsx`: This file is used to render the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is used to define the HTML document structure of the application. It includes necessary metadata and scripts for the application.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is used to initialize the application and set up necessary libraries. It imports several libraries, sets up a QueryClient for 'react-query', and a Toaster for toast notifications.

The `api` subdirectory contains files that handle API requests and responses, interact with OpenAI and Google APIs, and manage the 'home' page of the application. These files are used to handle various API interactions and manage the functionality of the home page.
