## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The Spinner component is a crucial part of the user experience, providing feedback to the user when an operation is in progress and preventing confusion or frustration.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component, exporting the default export from `Spinner.tsx`. This setup simplifies imports elsewhere in the project, as the Spinner component can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` without specifying the `Spinner.tsx` file.

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. The component accepts 'size' and 'className' as optional props, with 'size' controlling the spinner's dimensions and 'className' allowing for additional CSS classes. The spinner is created using SVG and includes an animation for the spinning effect.

The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Spinner.tsx` file. This file defines the Spinner component, which is a critical part of the user interface. The Spinner component provides visual feedback to the user when an operation is in progress, improving the user experience and preventing confusion or frustration.

The `Spinner.tsx` file is a React component that accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop determines the height and width of the spinner, defaulting to '1em' if not provided. The 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner, defaulting to an empty string if not provided. The spinner is created using SVG and has an animation applied to it to create the spinning effect.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate a loading state. It can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` thanks to the `index.ts` file, which exports the default export from `Spinner.tsx`.

Here is an example of how the Spinner component might be used in a React component:

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

function LoadingComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Loading...</p>
      <Spinner size="2em" className="my-spinner" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the Spinner component is imported from `components/Spinner` and used in a `LoadingComponent`. The Spinner's size is set to '2em', and it is given an additional CSS class of 'my-spinner'.
