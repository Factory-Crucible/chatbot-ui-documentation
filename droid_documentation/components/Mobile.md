## `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a crucial part of the project's responsive design strategy, ensuring that the chatbot interface remains user-friendly and functional across different device types. The directory currently contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component for the mobile application's navigation bar.

### Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is a lean structure, containing only one file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines the `Navbar` functional component, which is specifically designed for the mobile application's navigation bar.

### Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component within this directory. It defines the `Navbar` functional component, which is a critical part of the mobile user interface. This component is responsible for displaying the currently active chat conversation and providing an interface for initiating new conversations.

### Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It accepts two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`. The `selectedConversation` prop is an object of type `Conversation` that represents the currently active chat. The `onNewConversation` prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used within the application:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object of type `Conversation` representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that handles the initiation of new conversations.
