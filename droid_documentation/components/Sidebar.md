## components/Sidebar

The `components/Sidebar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It houses the TypeScript files that define the Sidebar component and its functionalities. The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The Sidebar component is a key part of the user interface, providing a navigational structure for the application.

### Contents

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains several files and a subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point, exporting the main Sidebar component from 'Sidebar.tsx'.
- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `components/Sidebar/components`: This subdirectory contains additional component files for managing the sidebar. Notably, it includes 'OpenCloseButton.tsx', which exports two components responsible for opening and closing the sidebar.

### Key Components

- `Sidebar.tsx`: The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The Sidebar component is a key part of the user interface, providing a navigational structure for the application.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: The SidebarButton component is a reusable button component with specific styling and behavior. It is used throughout the Sidebar component to provide consistent, styled buttons with specific behaviors.
- `components/Sidebar/components/OpenCloseButton.tsx`: The 'OpenCloseButton.tsx' file exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are responsible for opening and closing the sidebar, providing a key part of the sidebar's functionality.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Sidebar` directory are used to build and manage the sidebar of the chatbot UI. The Sidebar component is used throughout the application to provide a consistent navigational structure. The SidebarButton component is used within the Sidebar component to provide styled buttons with specific behaviors.

For example, the Sidebar component might be used in the main application component like this:

```typescript
<Sidebar
  isOpen={isOpen}
  addItemButtonTitle="Add Item"
  side="left"
  items={items}
  itemComponent={<ItemComponent />}
  folderComponent={<FolderComponent />}
  footerComponent={<FooterComponent />}
  searchTerm={searchTerm}
  handleSearchTerm={handleSearchTerm}
  toggleOpen={toggleOpen}
  handleCreateItem={handleCreateItem}
  handleCreateFolder={handleCreateFolder}
  handleDrop={handleDrop}
/>
```

In this example, the Sidebar component is being used with several props to control its behavior and appearance. The `isOpen` prop controls whether the sidebar is open or not, the `addItemButtonTitle` prop provides the title for the "Add Item" button, and the `side` prop controls which side of the screen the sidebar appears on. The `items`, `itemComponent`, and `folderComponent` props control the items that appear in the sidebar and how they are rendered. The `footerComponent` prop allows for a custom footer to be added to the sidebar. The `searchTerm` and `handleSearchTerm` props control the search functionality of the sidebar. The `toggleOpen`, `handleCreateItem`, `handleCreateFolder`, and `handleDrop` props provide handlers for various actions within the sidebar.
