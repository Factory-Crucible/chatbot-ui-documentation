# `components/Mobile2` Directory

The `components/Mobile2` directory is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project. This specific directory, `components/Mobile2`, is dedicated to the `Mobile2` module of the project. It contains a single TypeScript file named `Navbar.tsx` that defines a functional React component called `Navbar`. This component is a key part of the user interface, rendering a navigation bar that displays the name of a selected conversation and an icon for creating a new conversation.

## Contents

The `components/Mobile2` directory contains only one file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines a functional React component named `Navbar`. The component is part of the `Mobile2` module in the `components` directory. It accepts two props: `selectedConversation` of type `Conversation` and `onNewConversation` which is a function. The component renders a navigation bar with a `selectedConversation` name and an `IconPlus` icon. When the `IconPlus` icon is clicked, it triggers the `onNewConversation` function.

## Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the `Navbar` component, which is a functional React component that plays a crucial role in the user interface of the chatbot application. The `Navbar` component is responsible for rendering a navigation bar that displays the name of a selected conversation and an icon for creating a new conversation. This component is a critical part of the `Mobile2` module, contributing to the overall functionality of the chatbot user interface.

## Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the `Mobile2` module to render a navigation bar in the user interface. It accepts two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`. The `selectedConversation` prop is of type `Conversation` and represents the currently selected conversation that is displayed in the navigation bar. The `onNewConversation` prop is a function that is triggered when the `IconPlus` icon in the navigation bar is clicked, initiating the creation of a new conversation.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
import { Navbar } from './components/Mobile2/Navbar';

const App = () => {
  const [selectedConversation, setSelectedConversation] = useState<Conversation>(null);

  const handleNewConversation = () => {
    // Logic for creating a new conversation
  };

  return (
    <Navbar
      selectedConversation={selectedConversation}
      onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example, the `Navbar` component is imported from the `components/Mobile2/Navbar` file. It is then used in the `App` component, with the `selectedConversation` state and the `handleNewConversation` function passed as props. The `handleNewConversation` function would contain the logic for creating a new conversation when the `IconPlus` icon is clicked.
