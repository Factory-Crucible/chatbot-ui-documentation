## Styles Directory

The Styles directory in the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase is a dedicated location for managing the global styles of the project. It is a critical part of the codebase as it defines the visual aesthetics of the chatbot user interface. The directory contains a single file, 'globals.css', which holds the global styles for the project. This file is responsible for setting the overall look and feel of the application, including the background color, scrollbar styles, and media queries for responsive design. It also includes custom styles for specific HTML elements and classes, ensuring a consistent visual experience across the application.

### Contents

The Styles directory is simple and straightforward, containing only one file:

- `globals.css`: This is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file that contains global styles for the project. It includes the import of base, components, and utilities from Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The file also contains custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, including its track, thumb, and corner, with different styles for hover states. It sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade. Additionally, it contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Lastly, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Key Components

The key component in the Styles directory is the `globals.css` file. This file is crucial as it sets the global styles for the entire project. It imports base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework, which provides a wide range of pre-designed classes for rapid UI development. The file also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, ensuring a consistent and visually pleasing scrollbar across different web browsers. It sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade, providing a visually appealing contrast for the chatbot UI. The file also contains a media query for responsive design, ensuring the chatbot UI is accessible and visually pleasing on devices with different screen sizes. Lastly, it includes custom styles for 'pre' elements containing a 'div' with the class 'codeblock', ensuring a consistent visual experience for code blocks in the chatbot UI.

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file in the Styles directory is used to set the global styles for the chatbot UI. It is included in the root of the project and is applied to the entire application. The file is written in CSS, a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.

For example, the file includes a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px. This media query adjusts the width of 'pre' elements under this condition, ensuring the chatbot UI is responsive and visually pleasing on smaller screens:

```css
@media (max-width: 720px) {
  pre {
    width: 90%;
  }
}
```

The file also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. These styles are applied to the scrollbar's track, thumb, and corner, with different styles for hover states. This ensures a consistent and visually pleasing scrollbar across different web browsers:

```css
::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 12px;
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  background: #2d3748;
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: #a0aec0;
  border-radius: 10px;
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover {
  background: #718096;
}
```

These examples demonstrate how the `globals.css` file is used to set the global styles for the chatbot UI, ensuring a consistent and visually pleasing user experience across different devices and web browsers.
