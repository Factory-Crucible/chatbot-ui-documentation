## components/Mobile

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot user interface. It houses the `Navbar.tsx` file, a TypeScript file that defines a functional component named 'Navbar'. This component is specifically designed for the navigation bar of the mobile application. The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory contains a single file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines a functional component named 'Navbar' for the mobile application. The component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of a chat application. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation', which is an object of type 'Conversation', and 'onNewConversation', which is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button that, when clicked, triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Navbar` component defined in the `Navbar.tsx` file. This component is crucial as it provides the navigation bar for the mobile version of the chatbot user interface. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The 'selectedConversation' prop represents the currently active chat, while the 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated. This component is responsible for displaying the name of the selected conversation and providing an 'IconPlus' button for initiating new conversations.

### Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot user interface. It is responsible for displaying the navigation bar, which includes the name of the currently selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button for initiating new conversations.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started.
