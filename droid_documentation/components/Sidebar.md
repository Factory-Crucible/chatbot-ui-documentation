### Usage & Examples

The files in the `components/Sidebar` directory are used to define and manage the Sidebar component of the chatbot UI. The Sidebar component is a key part of the user interface, providing a navigational structure for the application. It is designed to be responsive, with its appearance and behavior changing based on the screen size.

For example, the `Sidebar.tsx` file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The Sidebar component accepts a variety of props, including flags for whether it's open, the side it should appear on, and handlers for various actions such as creating items and folders, and handling search terms.

The `SidebarButton.tsx` file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. The SidebarButton component is used within the Sidebar component to provide interactive elements for the user.

The `OpenCloseButton.tsx` file, located in the `components/Sidebar/components` subdirectory, exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are used to open and close the sidebar, respectively. They accept two props: 'onClick', a function triggered when the button is clicked, and 'side', a string indicating the side of the screen where the sidebar is located.
