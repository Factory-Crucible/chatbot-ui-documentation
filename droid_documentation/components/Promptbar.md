## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. This feature is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. The directory contains TypeScript files and a subdirectory, each playing a specific role in the functionality of the 'Promptbar' component.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory named `components`. The TypeScript files include `index.ts`, `PromptBar.context.tsx`, `Promptbar.tsx`, and `Promptbar.state.tsx`. The `index.ts` file serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the default export from the `Promptbar.tsx` file. The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. The `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file, representing the sidebar in the user interface with functions for managing prompts and folders. The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory contains related components. These include `Prompts.tsx` which renders a list of prompts, `PromptbarSettings.tsx` which is for 'Promptbar' settings, `Prompt.tsx` which manages prompts, `PromptModal.tsx` which renders a modal for editing prompts, and `PromptFolders.tsx` which manages folders within the 'Promptbar'.

### Key Components

The `Promptbar.tsx` file is a key component in this directory. It represents the 'Promptbar' feature of the application, a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. This component uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects, and it imports several other components and contexts to handle actions like toggling the prompt bar, creating, deleting, and updating prompts, and dropping prompts into folders.

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is another critical component. It defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. This context is used throughout the 'Promptbar' component and its subcomponents to manage the state and behavior of prompts.

The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file is also important as it defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component. This state is used in the 'Promptbar' component and its subcomponents to manage the state of the 'Promptbar' feature.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders in the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to implement the 'Promptbar' feature of the chatbot-ui application. The 'Promptbar' is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders.

The `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file for the 'Promptbar'. It uses the `PromptBar.context.tsx` for state and handlers for prompts, and the `Promptbar.state.tsx` for the initial state and interface of the 'Promptbar'. It also imports several components from the `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory to handle various functionalities of the 'Promptbar'.

For example, the `Prompt.tsx` component in the `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory is used to handle actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and manage local state for various functionalities. The `PromptModal.tsx` component is used to render a modal for editing a prompt, with internationalization support. The `PromptFolders.tsx` component is used to handle the display and functionality of folders within the 'Promptbar', including the dropping of prompts into folders.

The `index.ts` file in the `components/Promptbar` directory serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, allowing other parts of the application to import the 'Promptbar' component directly from the 'Promptbar' directory.
