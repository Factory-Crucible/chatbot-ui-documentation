# `__tests__` Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in this project. It is a crucial part of the codebase, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the application's functionality. This directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within `utils`, there's another subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format. There are no other subdirectories within the `app` directory.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains the following subdirectory:

- `utils`: This subdirectory serves as a testing suite for utility functions within the application. It contains a subdirectory named `app`, which houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.

### `__tests__/utils` Directory

The `__tests__/utils` directory is a testing suite for utility functions within the application. It contains a subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations. This file ensures that exported objects align with the expected format for each version and tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one. The test checks that the updated data matches the expected structure of the current format. There are no further subdirectories within the `app` directory.

#### `__tests__/utils/app` Directory

The directory `__tests__/utils/app` contains test files for the application's utility functions. Specifically, it includes a file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file tests utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It verifies different versions of the export format, ensuring that a given object matches the expected format for each version. The file also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest one, and checks that the cleaned data aligns with the expected structure of the latest format. There are no subdirectories in this directory.

##### `__tests__/utils/app/importExports.test.ts` File

This is a test file for utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It imports several functions and types from the application's utility and types directories. The file contains tests for different versions of the export format, checking whether a given object matches the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest format. The tests ensure that the cleaned data matches the expected structure of the latest format.

## Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file. This file is crucial as it tests the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the exported objects conform to the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one. This function is essential for maintaining data consistency and compatibility across different versions of the export format.

## Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house all the test files and suites for the application. For instance, the `importExports.test.ts` file within the `__tests__/utils/app` directory is used to test the import and export operations of the application. It verifies that the exported objects match the expected format for each version and that the `cleanData` function correctly updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

Here is a simplified example of how the tests in `importExports.test.ts` might be structured:

```javascript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {
    it('should return true for v1 format', () => {
      // Test logic here
    });
    it('should return false for non-v1 formats', () => {
      // Test logic here
    });
  });
  // Other tests for different versions...

  describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
    describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {
      it('should return the latest format', () => {
        // Test logic here
      });
    });
    // Other tests for cleaning different versions...
  });
});
```

This example shows how the tests are organized into different `describe` blocks for each function, with individual `it` blocks for each test case. This structure helps to keep the tests organized and easy to understand.
