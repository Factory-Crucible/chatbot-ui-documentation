## pages
The `pages` directory is a critical part of the project, containing key files and a subdirectory for handling API requests and responses. It includes the main entry point for the home page, a custom Document for the Next.js application, and a custom App component for initializing pages and setting up libraries.

### Contents
The `pages` directory contains three files: `index.tsx`, `_document.tsx`, and `_app.tsx`, and one subdirectory: `api`.

- `index.tsx`: Serves as the main entry point for the home page, exporting a React component and a server-side rendering function.
- `_document.tsx`: Defines a custom Document for the Next.js application, providing an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.
- `_app.tsx`: Initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api`: Handles API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components
- `index.tsx`: The main entry point for the home page, crucial for rendering the home page of the application.
- `_document.tsx`: Defines the HTML document structure, critical for the overall layout and metadata of the application.
- `_app.tsx`: Initializes pages and sets up libraries, essential for the functionality and internationalization of the application.
- `api`: Handles API requests and responses, key for the interaction between the application and external APIs.

### Usage & Examples
The files in the `pages` directory are used to define the structure and functionality of the application's pages. For instance, `index.tsx` is used to render the home page of the application, while `_document.tsx` and `_app.tsx` are used to set up the overall layout and functionality of the application. The `api` subdirectory is used to handle API requests and responses, interacting with external APIs like OpenAI and Google APIs.

Example of `index.tsx` usage:
```typescript
export { default, getServerSideProps } from './api/home';
```

Example of `_document.tsx` usage:
```typescript
type Props = DocumentProps & {};
export default function Document(props: Props) {}
```

Example of `_app.tsx` usage:
```typescript
function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps<{}>) {}
```
