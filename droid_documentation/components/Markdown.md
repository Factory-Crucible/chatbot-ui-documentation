## `components/Markdown` Directory

The `components/Markdown` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to handling markdown rendering within the chatbot UI. It contains two TypeScript component files, `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx` and `CodeBlock.tsx`, which are responsible for rendering markdown content and displaying code blocks in markdown format, respectively. These components are integral to the chatbot UI's ability to display rich text content and code snippets, enhancing the user experience and providing a more interactive and engaging interface.

### Contents

The `components/Markdown` directory contains the following files:

- `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx`: This TypeScript component file exports a memoized functional component named `MemoizedReactMarkdown`. The component uses the `react-markdown` library to render markdown content and optimizes performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders through memoization.
- `CodeBlock.tsx`: This TypeScript component file exports a functional component named `CodeBlock`. The component is used to display code blocks in markdown format, with syntax highlighting provided by `react-syntax-highlighter`. It also includes functionality to copy the code to the clipboard and download the code as a file.

### Key Components

The `components/Markdown` directory houses two key components that play a significant role in the chatbot UI's functionality:

- `MemoizedReactMarkdown`: This component is crucial for rendering markdown content within the chatbot UI. By using the `react-markdown` library, it enables the display of rich text content. Furthermore, its use of React's `memo` function for memoization ensures that the component only re-renders when necessary, thereby optimizing performance.
- `CodeBlock`: This component enhances the chatbot UI's interactivity by displaying code blocks in markdown format. It uses `react-syntax-highlighter` for syntax highlighting, making the code easier to read and understand. Additionally, it provides the ability to copy the code to the clipboard and download the code as a file, offering users more flexibility in how they interact with code snippets.

### Usage & Examples

The `MemoizedReactMarkdown` and `CodeBlock` components are used throughout the chatbot UI to render markdown content and display code blocks, respectively.

For instance, the `MemoizedReactMarkdown` component might be used to render user-generated markdown content in a chat message. It would take the markdown content as a prop and render it into HTML, ensuring that any markdown syntax is correctly interpreted and displayed.

```typescript
<MemoizedReactMarkdown>{userMessage}</MemoizedReactMarkdown>
```

The `CodeBlock` component, on the other hand, might be used to display a code snippet within a tutorial or help message. It would take the programming language and the code snippet as props, and display the code with appropriate syntax highlighting.

```typescript
<CodeBlock language="javascript" value={codeSnippet} />
```

These examples represent typical usage patterns for these components within the chatbot UI codebase.
