## components/Mobile Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a specialized directory that houses the components specifically designed for the mobile interface. The directory currently contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component named 'Navbar'. This component is a crucial part of the mobile application's user interface, as it provides the navigation bar for the chat application. The 'Navbar' component is designed to accept two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The 'selectedConversation' prop represents the currently active chat, while the 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated. The 'Navbar' component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button, which when clicked, triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

### Contents

- `Navbar.tsx`: This file defines the 'Navbar' functional component for the mobile application's navigation bar. It is designed to be used in a chat application and accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

### Key Components

This component is crucial for the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application as it provides the navigation bar for the chat application. It is designed to accept two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The 'selectedConversation' prop represents the currently active chat, while the 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated.

### Usage & Examples

The 'Navbar' component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a functional component that provides the navigation bar for the chat application. The component is designed to accept two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The 'selectedConversation' prop is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat. The 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated.
