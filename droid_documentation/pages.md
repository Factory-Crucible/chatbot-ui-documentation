# `pages` Directory

The `pages` directory is a fundamental part of the `chatbot-ui` project, serving as the container for key files and a subdirectory that are integral to the application's operation. This directory is responsible for defining the main entry point for the home page, setting up the custom Document and App components for the Next.js application, and managing the API requests and responses. The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory work together to provide the structure and functionality of the application's pages, contributing to the overall user interface of the chatbot.

## Contents

The `pages` directory contains three TypeScript files and one subdirectory:

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.

- `api`: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

## Key Components

The `pages` directory contains several key components that are critical to the operation of the `chatbot-ui` project:

- `index.tsx`: This file is crucial as it serves as the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is important as it defines the HTML document structure for the Next.js application, including metadata and scripts. It also supports internationalization, making the application accessible to users in different languages.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is significant as it initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, contributing to the application's accessibility.

- `api`: This subdirectory is vital as it contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and managing the 'home' page of the application.

## Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used to define the structure and functionality of the application's pages. For instance, the `index.tsx` file serves as the main entry point for the home page of the application, exporting a React component and a server-side rendering function. The `_document.tsx` file defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization. The `_app.tsx` file initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries, and also supports internationalization. The `api` subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and managing the 'home' page of the application.

For example, the `index.tsx` file might look something like this:

```tsx
export { default, getServerSideProps } from './api/home';
```

This code exports the default export and the `getServerSideProps` function from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory. The default export is likely the main React component for the home page, while `getServerSideProps` is a function used in Next.js for server-side rendering on the home page.
