## Types Directory

The `types` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses TypeScript files that define various interfaces, types, and constants used throughout the project. These definitions provide a consistent structure for data and ensure type safety, which is a key aspect of TypeScript. The types defined in this directory are used in various parts of the application, such as components, hooks, services, and utilities. They help in structuring data related to different aspects of the application, including settings, data pairs, prompts, plugins, chat systems, storage schema, OpenAI models, error messages, folders, and export functionality.

### Contents

The `types` directory contains several TypeScript files, each defining different types, interfaces, and constants. There are no subdirectories within this directory. The files in this directory include:

- `data.ts`: Defines a key-value pair structure.
- `prompt.ts`: Outlines a prompt object.
- `plugin.ts`: Defines structures for plugins.
- `settings.ts`: Defines theme settings.
- `storage.ts`: Defines the local storage schema for a chatbot UI.
- `openai.ts`: Defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers.
- `chat.ts`: Defines structures for chat systems.
- `export.ts`: Relates to the application's export functionality.
- `google.ts`: Structures data related to Google's services.
- `folder.ts`: Defines a 'Folder' object.
- `index.ts`: An empty placeholder file.
- `error.ts`: Structures error messages.
- `env.ts`: Represents environment variables for the OpenAI API.

### Key Components

Several files in the `types` directory play a critical role in the functioning of the chatbot-ui application:

- `settings.ts`: This file defines the theme settings for the application, ensuring a consistent user interface across the application.
- `prompt.ts`: This file outlines the structure of a prompt object, which is central to the chatbot's functionality.
- `storage.ts`: This file defines the local storage schema for the chatbot UI, ensuring consistent storage and retrieval of data.
- `openai.ts`: This file defines the structure of OpenAI models and their identifiers, which is crucial for the chatbot's interaction with the OpenAI API.
- `chat.ts`: This file defines structures for chat systems, which are central to the chatbot's functionality.

### Usage & Examples

The types defined in the `types` directory are used throughout the codebase. For instance, the `Prompt` interface defined in `prompt.ts` is used to structure prompt objects. Here's an example of how it might be used:

```typescript
let prompt: Prompt = {
  id: '1',
  name: 'Greeting',
  description: 'A greeting message',
  content: 'Hello, how can I assist you today?',
  model: OpenAIModels.GPT_3_5,
  folderId: null
};
```

Similarly, the `Settings` interface defined in `settings.ts` is used to structure theme settings. Here's an example:

```typescript
let settings: Settings = {
  theme: 'dark'
};
```

The `KeyValuePair` interface defined in `data.ts` is used wherever a key-value pair structure is needed. Here's an example:

```typescript
let pair: KeyValuePair = {
  key: 'theme',
  value: 'dark'
};
```

The `LocalStorage` interface defined in `storage.ts` is used to structure the local storage schema for the chatbot UI. Here's an example:

```typescript
let storage: LocalStorage = {
  apiKey: 'abc123',
  conversationHistory: [],
  selectedConversation: null,
  theme: 'light',
  folders: [],
  prompts: [],
  showChatbar: true,
  showPromptbar: false,
  pluginKeys: []
};
```

These are just a few examples of how the types defined in the `types` directory are used. The actual usage in the codebase may vary depending on the context and requirements.
