## Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a pivotal part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the container for key files and subdirectories that define the structure and functionality of the application's pages. This directory is integral to the Next.js framework, which treats every file in the `pages` directory as a route in the application. The files in this directory, along with its subdirectories, are responsible for rendering the user interface, handling API requests and responses, and managing the state of the application.

### Contents

The `pages` directory is composed of three TypeScript files and an `api` subdirectory. Each file and subdirectory plays a unique role in the application:

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.

- `api`: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

The `pages` directory houses several critical files and subdirectories that contribute to the functionality of the chatbot-ui application:

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory. This structure allows for a clear separation of concerns, with the `home` file handling the logic and state management, and the `index.tsx` file responsible for rendering the home page.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization. This file is crucial for setting up the HTML structure of the application and including global CSS.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization. This file is essential for setting up the application and initializing libraries that are used across multiple pages.

- `api`: This subdirectory is a key part of the application, handling API requests and responses, and interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs. It contains several files that manage different aspects of the application, such as chat functionality, Google search, and the home page.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories in the `pages` directory are used to render the user interface, handle API requests and responses, and manage the state of the application. Here are some examples of how they are used:

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory. This structure allows the `home` file to handle the logic and state management, while the `index.tsx` file is responsible for rendering the home page.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization. This file is used to set up the HTML structure of the application and include global CSS.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component that initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization. This file is used to set up the application and initialize libraries that are used across multiple pages.

- `api`: This subdirectory contains several files that manage different aspects of the application, such as chat functionality, Google search, and the home page. These files handle API requests and responses, interact with OpenAI and Google APIs, and manage the state of the application.
