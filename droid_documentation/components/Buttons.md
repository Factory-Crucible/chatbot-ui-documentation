## `components/Buttons` Directory

The `components/Buttons` directory is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the chatbot-ui project. Each component in this directory is encapsulated in its own subdirectory, and in this case, we are focusing on the `Buttons` directory. This directory is dedicated to defining and managing the various buttons used throughout the chatbot-ui project. It contains a subdirectory named `SidebarActionButton` which houses the definition and export of a specific button component used in the sidebar of the application.

### Contents

The `components/Buttons` directory contains one subdirectory:

- `SidebarActionButton`: This subdirectory contains the definition and export of the `SidebarActionButton` component. The component is a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`. The `handleClick` prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the `children` prop renders any child elements within the button.

### Key Components

The `components/Buttons` directory contains one key component:

- `SidebarActionButton`: This is a React component defined in the `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file. It is a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`. The `handleClick` prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the `children` prop renders any child elements within the button. The button's style includes a minimum width of 20px, padding of 1, and different text colors for normal and hover states.

### Usage & Examples

The `SidebarActionButton` component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project wherever a button with specific styling and functionality is required in the sidebar. The `handleClick` prop allows the parent component to define what happens when the button is clicked, and the `children` prop allows the parent component to define what is rendered within the button.

For example, a `SidebarActionButton` might be used in the sidebar to toggle a settings menu. The `handleClick` prop would be a function that toggles the visibility of the settings menu, and the `children` prop would be a settings icon.

```typescript
<SidebarActionButton handleClick={toggleSettingsMenu}>
  <SettingsIcon />
</SidebarActionButton>
```

In this example, when the `SidebarActionButton` is clicked, the `toggleSettingsMenu` function is called, and the settings icon is rendered within the button.
