# `__tests__` Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the `chatbot-ui` project. It is an integral part of the codebase, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the code. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within `utils`, there's another subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains one subdirectory, `utils`. This subdirectory is a testing suite for the utility functions within the application. It contains a subdirectory named `app`, which houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations. This file ensures that exported objects align with the expected format for each version and tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one. The test checks that the updated data matches the expected structure of the current format.

## Key Components

The key component in the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file located in the `__tests__/utils/app` subdirectory. This file tests utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It verifies different versions of the export format, ensuring that a given object matches the expected format for each version. The file also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest one, and checks that the cleaned data aligns with the expected structure of the latest format.

## Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house all the test suites for the `chatbot-ui` project. The `importExports.test.ts` file, for instance, is used to test the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one.

Here is a simplified example of how the `importExports.test.ts` file might be structured:

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  // Test cases for export format functions
});

describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
  // Test cases for cleanData function
});
```

In this example, the `describe` function is used to group related test cases. The first group tests the export format functions, ensuring that a given object matches the expected format for each version. The second group tests the `cleanData` function, checking that the cleaned data aligns with the expected structure of the latest format.
