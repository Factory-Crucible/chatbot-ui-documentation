## Styles Directory

The `styles` directory is a dedicated space for managing the global styles of the chatbot-ui project. It is a crucial part of the project's structure, as it defines the visual aesthetics of the user interface. The directory contains a single file, `globals.css`, which holds the global styles for the project. This file is responsible for setting the overall look and feel of the application, including the background color, scrollbar styles, and responsive design adjustments.

### Contents

The `styles` directory contains one file:

- `globals.css`: This file is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file that contains global styles for the project. It includes the import of base, components, and utilities from Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The file also contains custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, including its track, thumb, and corner, with different styles for hover states. It sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade. Additionally, it contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Lastly, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file is used to define the global styles for the project. It is included in the project's build process and applied to the entire application. The file is written in CSS and uses the Tailwind CSS framework for utility-first styling. It also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar and sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade.

For example, the file includes a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px. This media query adjusts the width of 'pre' elements under this condition, ensuring that the application's layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. The file also removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock', providing a clean and consistent look for code blocks across the application.
