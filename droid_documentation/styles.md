## Styles Directory

The `styles` directory plays a crucial role in the visual presentation of the `chatbot-ui` project. It houses the `globals.css` file, which is responsible for defining the global styles that apply to the entire application. This directory is integral to the project's user interface, as it ensures consistency in the visual design across different components and pages. The styles defined in this directory are applied universally, affecting every element in the project unless overridden by more specific styles.

### Contents

The `styles` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing a single file:

- `globals.css`: This file is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) that contains global styles for the project. It is responsible for importing base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework, and it also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. The file sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade and contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. It also removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Key Components

The `globals.css` file is the key component in this directory. It serves as the central location for defining global styles that apply to the entire application. This file is critical to the project's visual consistency and overall user interface design. It leverages the utility-first CSS framework, Tailwind CSS, to provide a set of low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML. Additionally, it contains custom styles for the webkit scrollbar and media queries to ensure the application is responsive and visually appealing across different screen sizes.

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file is used to define global styles that apply to the entire application. It is loaded at the start of the application, ensuring that the defined styles are applied universally across the project. The file is written in CSS, a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.

For example, the file sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade, ensuring that all pages of the application have a consistent background color. It also includes a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. This ensures that the application is responsive and maintains a consistent layout across different screen sizes.

The `globals.css` file also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. This includes styles for the track, thumb, and corner of the scrollbar, with different styles for hover states. This ensures that the scrollbar is consistent with the overall design of the application and enhances the user experience by providing a custom and visually appealing scrollbar.

Lastly, the file removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'. This ensures that code blocks are displayed correctly and without unnecessary padding, enhancing readability for users.
