## Services Directory

The `services` directory is a critical part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It contains two TypeScript files that define custom React hooks, `useErrorService` and `useApiService`. These hooks are integral to the functionality of the chatbot UI, providing localized error messages and facilitating API calls respectively. The `services` directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Contents

The `services` directory contains the following TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named `useErrorService`. The hook uses the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next` to provide localized error messages. It returns a function `getModelsError` that takes an error object and returns an `ErrorMessage` object with a title, status code, and list of messages. The title and messages are translated using the `useTranslation` hook.

- `useApiService.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useApiService`. This hook uses another custom hook `useFetch` to make API calls. The hook provides a function `getModels` which makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint. The function accepts an object of type `GetModelsRequestProps` and an optional `AbortSignal` as parameters. The `GetModelsRequestProps` interface is also defined in this file.

### Key Components

The `services` directory contains two key TypeScript files:

- `errorService.ts`: The `useErrorService` hook defined in this file is crucial for providing localized error messages to the user. By using the `useTranslation` hook, it ensures that error messages are displayed in the user's preferred language. The `getModelsError` function it provides takes an error object and returns an `ErrorMessage` object, which includes a title, status code, and list of messages. This function is used throughout the codebase to handle errors and provide user-friendly error messages.

- `useApiService.ts`: The `useApiService` hook defined in this file is essential for making API calls within the application. It uses the `useFetch` hook to make these calls, and provides a `getModels` function that makes a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint. This function is used throughout the codebase to retrieve models from the API.

### Usage & Examples

The `services` directory is used throughout the codebase to provide localized error messages and make API calls.

The `useErrorService` hook is typically used in components that need to handle errors and display error messages to the user. For example, a component might use the `useErrorService` hook to get a `getModelsError` function, and then use this function to handle any errors that occur when making API calls.

The `useApiService` hook is typically used in components that need to make API calls. For example, a component might use the `useApiService` hook to get a `getModels` function, and then use this function to make a POST request to the `/api/models` endpoint.
