Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the repository, including its purpose, the technologies used, major components, conventions, structure, main flows, and testing principles. This documentation is generated and maintained by the Documentation Droid and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes.

## Overview

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is a Docker-based Node.js project that serves as a chatbot user interface (UI). It is designed to be a comprehensive solution for managing chatbot interactions, including handling API requests, managing conversations, and providing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the chatbot.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a robust and efficient chatbot UI. It is designed to handle various aspects of chatbot interactions, from managing API requests and responses to providing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the chatbot. This repository is a crucial part of a larger system, interacting with other services to provide a comprehensive chatbot solution.

### Technologies Used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies. It is a Node.js project that uses Docker for containerization. The project uses TypeScript for static typing, and the TypeScript compiler is configured using the 'tsconfig.json' file. The UI is built using React, and the project uses the Next.js framework for server-side rendering. For styling, the project uses Tailwind CSS, and the styles are configured using PostCSS. The project also uses Kubernetes for orchestration, with the configurations stored in the 'k8s' directory.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different aspect of the chatbot UI. The 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants.

### Conventions

The codebase follows certain conventions for file naming and other aspects. For instance, the 'types' directory contains TypeScript files defining various interfaces, types, and constants used throughout the project. The '**tests**' directory is dedicated to testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory serving as a testing suite.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized in a way that separates different aspects of the project into distinct directories. Some directories are commonly used and others are not. Some contain lots of code, and others contain static assets and are rarely utilized. The root directory contains configuration files for the project, Docker, and various tools like Makefile, Prettier, PostCSS, and Tailwind CSS. It also includes a Dockerfile for creating a Docker image and a 'docker-compose.yml' for defining and managing the Docker application. The 'package.json' file lists the project's dependencies and scripts.

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around managing chatbot interactions. These include handling API requests and responses, managing conversations, and providing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the chatbot. Some of these flows are specific to a particular user story, but some patterns recur in many cases in the repo, while some occur once but get called frequently so they are important to understand. For a more in-depth understanding of these flows, refer to the individual documentation files in the directory.

### System Connections

The system connections in the codebase include interactions with external APIs such as OpenAI and Google APIs. The 'pages/api' directory contains files for handling these API requests and responses. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and making API calls. Understanding these connections is crucial for understanding how data gets from one end of the system to the other.

## Testing Principles

The testing principles in the codebase are outlined in the '**tests**' directory. This directory is dedicated to testing within the project, with a 'utils' subdirectory serving as a testing suite. The 'importExports.test.ts' file in the 'utils/app' subdirectory validates the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. It also tests a function named 'cleanData', which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one.
