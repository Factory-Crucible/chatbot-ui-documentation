## components/Search Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a part of the `chatbot-ui` project's component architecture, specifically designed to handle the search functionality within the user interface. This directory contains two main files: `Search.tsx` and `index.ts`. The `Search.tsx` file is a TypeScript React component that exports a functional component named 'Search'. This component is responsible for rendering the search input field and managing the search functionality. The `index.ts` file serves as the public interface for the directory, exporting the default from `Search.tsx`.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains the following files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file. It exports a functional component 'Search' that takes in three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.

- `index.ts`: This file exports the default export from the sibling file 'Search.tsx'. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory. In this case, any other parts of the code that import from the 'Search' directory will automatically receive the default export from 'Search.tsx'.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Search.tsx` file. This file exports a functional React component named 'Search', which is responsible for rendering the search input field and managing the search functionality. The component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' prop is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' prop is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.

### Usage & Examples

The `Search` component is used within the `chatbot-ui` project to provide a search functionality in the user interface. It is imported from other parts of the codebase using the `index.ts` file in the `components/Search` directory. The 'placeholder' prop can be used to display a custom placeholder text in the search input field when it is empty. The 'searchTerm' prop is used to display the current search term in the input field. The 'onSearch' prop is a function that is called when the value of the input field changes or when the 'X' icon is clicked.

Here is an example of how the `Search` component might be used:

```typescript
import Search from '../components/Search';

function App() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

  const handleSearch = (term) => {
    setSearchTerm(term);
    // Perform search operation...
  };

  return (
    <Search
      placeholder="Search..."
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      onSearch={handleSearch}
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, the `Search` component is imported from the `components/Search` directory. It is then used in the `App` component, with the 'placeholder' prop set to "Search...", the 'searchTerm' prop set to the state variable 'searchTerm', and the 'onSearch' prop set to the 'handleSearch' function. When the value of the search input field changes, the 'handleSearch' function is called with the new value, updating the 'searchTerm' state variable and performing the search operation.
