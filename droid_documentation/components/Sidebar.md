## `components/Sidebar`

The `components/Sidebar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It houses the TypeScript files that define the Sidebar component and its functionalities. The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The directory also includes a 'components' subdirectory, which contains additional component files for managing the sidebar.

### Contents

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

- `index.ts`: Serves as an entry point, exporting the main Sidebar component from 'Sidebar.tsx'.
- `Sidebar.tsx`: Defines the Sidebar component, a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: Defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `components/Sidebar/components`: A subdirectory containing additional component files for managing the sidebar.

### Key Components

- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.

### Usage & Examples

The Sidebar component is used to provide a sidebar in the chatbot UI. It takes a variety of props including flags for whether it's open, the side it should appear on, and handlers for various actions such as creating items and folders, and handling search terms. It also accepts components to render items, folders, and a footer. The Sidebar component itself is a functional component that conditionally renders different layouts based on whether it's open or not. It also handles drag and drop events.

The SidebarButton component is used within the Sidebar component. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. 'text' is a string that represents the button's label, 'icon' is a JSX.Element that represents the button's icon, and 'onClick' is a function that is executed when the button is clicked.

The 'components/Sidebar/components' subdirectory contains additional component files for managing the sidebar. Specifically, it includes the 'OpenCloseButton.tsx' file, which exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are responsible for opening and closing the sidebar, respectively. They accept two props: 'onClick', a function triggered when the button is clicked, and 'side', a string indicating the side of the screen where the sidebar is located. The 'CloseSidebarButton' displays an arrow icon pointing towards the sidebar, while the 'OpenSidebarButton' shows an arrow pointing away from it. The appearance of these components changes based on the screen size.
