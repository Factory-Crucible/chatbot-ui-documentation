## components/Folder

The `components/Folder` directory is a part of the chatbot-ui project's modular architecture, specifically within the components section. This directory is dedicated to the `Folder` component, a React component that symbolizes a folder in a file system. The `Folder` component is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui's user interface, providing a visual and interactive representation of a folder structure. This component is used across the application to display and manage folders, contributing to the overall functionality of the chatbot-ui.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two main files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. The `Folder` component represents a folder in a file system and includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. It uses several icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package.

- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this folder by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

There are no subdirectories in this directory.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It exports the `Folder` component, which is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui's user interface. The `Folder` component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component renders a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

The `index.ts` file, while not as complex as the `Folder.tsx` file, plays a crucial role in simplifying imports from this directory. By exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file, it allows other files to import from `index.ts`, which will automatically forward the import to `Folder.tsx`.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to represent and manage folders in the user interface. It is used in various parts of the application where a visual and interactive representation of a folder structure is needed.

For example, the `Folder` component might be used in a file explorer feature of the application. The component would be rendered for each folder in the file system, and the user could interact with the component to open or close the folder, rename the folder, or drag and drop files into the folder.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Folder` component might be used:

```typescript
import Folder from './components/Folder';

const App = () => {
  const folders = getFolders(); // This function would fetch the folders from the backend
  return (
    <div>
      {folders.map(folder => (
        <Folder
          key={folder.id}
          currentFolder={folder}
          searchTerm={""}
          handleDrop={handleDrop}
          folderComponent={[]}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, the `Folder` component is imported from the `components/Folder` directory and used to render a list of folders. The `currentFolder` prop is set to the current folder, the `searchTerm` prop is set to an empty string, the `handleDrop` prop is set to a function that handles drag and drop events, and the `folderComponent` prop is set to an empty array.
