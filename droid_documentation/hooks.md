## Hooks Directory

The `hooks` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to housing custom React hooks. These hooks are designed to encapsulate and manage specific aspects of state and side effects within the chatbot-ui project. The directory contains two TypeScript files: `useCreateReducer.ts` and `useFetch.ts`. Each of these files defines a custom hook that provides a unique functionality within the project, contributing to the overall efficiency and maintainability of the codebase.

### Contents

The `hooks` directory is composed of two TypeScript files:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook named `useCreateReducer` that is designed to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. It also defines two TypeScript types: `FieldNames` and `ActionType` that help manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.
- `useFetch.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook named `useFetch` for making HTTP requests. It defines two types, `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel`, to structure the request parameters. The hook provides methods for each HTTP verb and uses a helper function `handleFetch` to perform the actual fetch operation.

### Key Components

The `hooks` directory contains two key TypeScript files that define custom React hooks:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: The `useCreateReducer` hook is a critical component in managing state within the chatbot-ui project. By creating a typed reducer with dispatch and state, it enhances type safety and predictability in state management. The `FieldNames` and `ActionType` types defined in this file further contribute to the robustness of the reducer, ensuring that the initial state and dispatch actions are correctly typed.
- `useFetch.ts`: The `useFetch` hook is a fundamental part of the project's interaction with external APIs. It provides a structured and consistent way to make HTTP requests, with methods for each HTTP verb. The `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel` types ensure that request parameters are correctly structured, while the `handleFetch` helper function takes care of constructing the request and handling the response, including error handling.

### Usage & Examples

The custom hooks defined in the `hooks` directory are used throughout the chatbot-ui project to manage state and handle HTTP requests:

- `useCreateReducer`: This hook is used when there is a need to manage complex state with a reducer. It is invoked with an object that contains an `initialState` property. The hook returns a `dispatch` function and the current state, which can be used to manage state in a predictable manner.
- `useFetch`: This hook is used to make HTTP requests to external APIs. It is invoked without any arguments and returns an object with methods for each HTTP verb. These methods can be used to make requests to specific URLs with optional request parameters. The `handleFetch` helper function within the hook takes care of constructing the request and handling the response, including error handling.

Note: The code snippets provided in the `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE` are not representative of typical usage patterns. They are provided to give a high-level overview of the structure and functionality of the custom hooks.
