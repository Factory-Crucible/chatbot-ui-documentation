## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The Spinner component is a crucial part of the user experience, providing feedback to the user when an operation is in progress and preventing confusion or frustration.

The Spinner component is designed with flexibility in mind, accepting optional props to control its size and additional CSS classes. This design allows the Spinner component to be reused in various parts of the project, adapting to different contexts and styles as needed.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. It accepts 'size' and 'className' as optional props, with 'size' controlling the spinner's dimensions and 'className' allowing for additional CSS classes. The spinner is created using SVG and includes an animation for the spinning effect.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component, exporting the default export from 'Spinner.tsx'. This setup simplifies imports elsewhere in the project, as the Spinner component can be imported directly from 'components/Spinner' without specifying the 'Spinner.tsx' file.

The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the Spinner component, defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file. This component is a critical part of the user interface, providing a visual indication of loading states. The Spinner component is designed to be reusable and adaptable, with optional props for size and additional CSS classes.

The `index.ts` file is also a key part of this directory, serving as the entry point for the Spinner component. This file simplifies the import process for the Spinner component, allowing it to be imported directly from 'components/Spinner' without specifying the 'Spinner.tsx' file.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate loading states. It can be used in any part of the user interface where an operation may take some time to complete, such as loading data from an API or performing a complex calculation.

For example, the Spinner component might be used in a component that fetches data from an API. While the data is being fetched, the Spinner component could be displayed to indicate to the user that the operation is in progress. Once the data has been fetched, the Spinner component could be replaced with the fetched data.

Here is a simplified example of how the Spinner component might be used:

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

function DataFetchingComponent() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData().then((fetchedData) => {
      setData(fetchedData);
      setIsLoading(false);
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? <Spinner /> : <DataDisplay data={data} />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the Spinner component is imported from 'components/Spinner'. It is then used in the `DataFetchingComponent` component to indicate a loading state while data is being fetched from an API. Once the data has been fetched, the Spinner component is replaced with the `DataDisplay` component, which displays the fetched data.
