Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the codebase and its structure, major components, technologies used, and conventions followed. This documentation is generated and maintained by the Documentation Droid and will be kept up to date as the codebase evolves.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to create a user interface for a chatbot. This repository is a part of a larger system that includes other services and components. The chatbot UI interacts with these services to provide a seamless user experience.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for developing server-side and networking applications.
- **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
- **TypeScript**: A strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, used for developing large-scale applications.
- **Docker**: A platform used for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of applications.
- **Kubernetes**: An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components:

- **Frontend Library**: The frontend library is built using ReactJS and TypeScript. It includes various components, hooks, and utility functions.
- **Backend Library**: The backend library is built using Node.js and handles API requests and responses.
- **CLI**: The CLI (Command Line Interface) is used for managing the application.

### Conventions

The codebase follows several conventions:

- **File Naming**: The file naming convention is camelCase for JavaScript and TypeScript files.
- **Directory Structure**: The directory structure is organized based on the functionality of the files. For example, all React components are located in the 'components' directory, and all utility functions are in the 'utils' directory.

## Structure

The codebase is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. Here is a high-level overview of the directory structure:

```
.
├── __tests__
├── components
├── droid_documentation
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
├── public
├── services
├── styles
├── types
└── utils
```

- **__tests__**: Contains test files for the application's utility functions.
- **components**: Houses various parts of the project, including the Sidebar, Settings, Buttons, Chatbar, Chat, Markdown, Folder, Spinner, Promptbar, Search, and Mobile components.
- **droid_documentation**: Contains detailed documentation for the project.
- **hooks**: Defines custom React hooks.
- **k8s**: Contains Kubernetes configurations.
- **pages**: Contains key files for the application and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests.
- **public**: Contains branding files and a 'screenshots' subdirectory.
- **services**: Contains services for error handling and API calls.
- **styles**: Contains global styles for the project.
- **types**: Defines various interfaces, types, and constants.
- **utils**: Contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project.

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the interaction between the user interface and the backend services. The user interacts with the chatbot UI, which sends requests to the backend services. The services process the requests and return responses, which are then displayed on the UI. This flow is common to many user stories in the repo.

### System Connections

The chatbot UI interacts with several internal and external services. Internally, it communicates with the backend services to process user requests. Externally, it interacts with the OpenAI and Google APIs to generate prompts and send responses. Understanding these connections is crucial for understanding the codebase.

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows several testing principles. It includes unit tests for individual functions and components, integration tests for testing the interaction between different parts of the system, and end-to-end tests for testing the system as a whole. The tests are written using Jest, a JavaScript testing framework.
