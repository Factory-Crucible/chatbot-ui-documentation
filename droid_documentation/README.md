Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. It provides a high-level overview of the codebase and its structure, and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes by the Documentation Droid.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to provide a user interface for a chatbot application. It is a Docker-based Node.js project that uses TypeScript and various libraries and frameworks to create a responsive and interactive chatbot UI. This repository is a crucial part of the larger Factory-Crucible project, interacting with other services to provide a comprehensive chatbot solution.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies:

- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types and other features to the language.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications.
- **Docker**: A platform used to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers.
- **Kubernetes**: An open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components:

- **Components**: This directory houses various parts of the project, each represented as a React component.
- **Pages**: This directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests.
- **Utils**: This directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project.
- **Hooks**: This directory defines custom React hooks.
- **Services**: This directory contains services for error handling and API calls.
- **Types**: This directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants.

### Conventions

The codebase follows certain conventions:

- **File Naming**: The files are named according to their functionality. For example, 'chat.ts' in the 'types' directory defines structures for chat systems.
- **Directory Structure**: The directories are structured semantically, with each directory containing related files. For example, the 'components' directory contains subdirectories for each component of the project.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. Some directories contain a significant amount of code, while others contain static assets and are rarely utilized. Here is a high-level overview of the directory structure:

```
.
├── __tests__
├── components
├── droid_documentation
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
├── public
├── services
├── styles
├── types
└── utils
```

For a more detailed view of each directory, please refer to the respective documentation files in the [`droid_documentation`](./droid_documentation/README.md) directory.

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the chatbot UI. The user interacts with the chatbot through the UI, triggering API calls to the backend. The responses from the backend are then processed and displayed in the chat interface. The flow of data from the user's input to the chatbot's response involves several parts of the codebase, including the 'components', 'pages', 'services', and 'utils' directories.

For a more in-depth understanding of these flows, please refer to the documentation files in the [`droid_documentation`](./droid_documentation/README.md) directory.

### System Connections

The codebase interacts with several external systems, including the OpenAI API and the Google Custom Search API. These interactions are handled primarily in the 'pages/api' directory, which contains files for making API requests and processing responses.

The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations for deploying the application, indicating the codebase's interaction with a Kubernetes cluster.

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows certain testing principles, with tests located in the '__tests__' directory. The tests validate the functionality of the application's utility functions and ensure that the import and export operations work as expected. The tests are written in TypeScript and use Jest as the testing framework.

For more details on testing, please refer to the [`__tests__ documentation`](./droid_documentation/__tests__.md).
