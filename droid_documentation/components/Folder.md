## components/Folder

The `components/Folder` directory is a dedicated space for the `Folder` component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a crucial part of the user interface, representing a folder in a file system. The `Folder` component is a React component written in TypeScript and is responsible for rendering a button and an input field, handling renaming and deleting of the folder, and managing drag and drop events. The component uses icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package. The directory contains two main files: `Folder.tsx` and `index.ts`.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory consists of two files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. The component accepts several props, maintains state, and renders a button and an input field. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.
- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this folder by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is a critical component in this directory. It exports the `Folder` component, which represents a folder in a file system. The component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. The component maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component renders a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the chatbot-ui project to represent a folder in a file system. It is a crucial part of the user interface, providing functionality for renaming and deleting folders, as well as handling drag and drop events. The component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components.

For example, the `Folder` component might be used in a parent component like this:

```typescript
import Folder from './components/Folder';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const currentFolder = { /* folder data */ };
  const searchTerm = 'example';
  const handleDrop = (e, folder) => { /* handle drop event */ };
  const folderComponent = [ /* list of folder components */ ];

  return (
    <Folder
      currentFolder={currentFolder}
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      handleDrop={handleDrop}
      folderComponent={folderComponent}
    />
  );
};
```

This example demonstrates how the `Folder` component can be imported and used in a parent component. The `Folder` component is rendered with several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components.
