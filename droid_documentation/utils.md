## Utils Directory

The `utils` directory is a central hub for utility files and subdirectories that serve various aspects of the project. It is structured to provide a clear separation of concerns, with each subdirectory focusing on a specific area of functionality. The `utils/app` subdirectory is dedicated to the chatbot UI project, managing everything from saving folders to local storage, mapping programming languages to file extensions, managing chat conversations, and handling the import and export of chatbot data. The `utils/server` subdirectory provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and a function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API. It also contains a function that standardizes text data. The `utils/data` subdirectory contains a 'throttle' function that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed. 

### Contents

The `utils` directory is composed of three subdirectories: `app`, `server`, and `data`, each with a specific focus. The `app` subdirectory contains utility files for the chatbot UI project, the `server` subdirectory provides utility functions for server-side operations, and the `data` subdirectory houses a function to control the execution rate of a given function. The directory also contains a `.DS_Store` file, which is a system file generated by macOS.

### Key Components

The `utils` directory contains several key components that are critical to the functionality of the project. In the `app` subdirectory, the `folders.ts` file manages saving folders to local storage, while the `codeblock.ts` file maps programming languages to their respective file extensions and generates random strings. The `prompts.ts` file provides functions for managing 'Prompt' objects, and the `api.ts` file determines the appropriate API endpoint based on the provided plugin. The `settings.ts` file manages application settings and interacts with local storage, and the `const.ts` file defines constants related to the OpenAI API and chatbot settings. The `conversation.ts` file provides functions for managing chat conversations, and the `importExport.ts` file handles the import and export of chatbot data.

In the `server` subdirectory, the `index.ts` file provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and an 'OpenAIStream' function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API. The `google.ts` file contains a 'cleanSourceText' function that standardizes text data by performing various transformations.

In the `data` subdirectory, the `throttle.ts` file defines a generic function 'throttle' that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `utils` directory are used throughout the codebase to provide utility functions and classes. For example, the `folders.ts` file in the `app` subdirectory is used to save an array of folders to the local storage. The `codeblock.ts` file is used to handle code blocks in various programming languages and generate unique identifiers within the application. The `prompts.ts` file provides utility functions for managing 'Prompt' objects, and the `api.ts` file is used to determine the appropriate API endpoint based on the provided plugin.

In the `server` subdirectory, the `index.ts` file provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and an 'OpenAIStream' function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API. The `google.ts` file is used to standardize text data before it is processed further.

In the `data` subdirectory, the `throttle.ts` file is used to control the rate at which a given function can be executed. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a function needs to be called repeatedly but with a controlled frequency to prevent overloading the system or the API it interacts with.
