# __tests__ Directory Documentation

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the `chatbot-ui` project. It is an integral part of the project's commitment to maintaining high-quality code and ensuring the reliability of the application's features and functionalities. The directory is structured to provide a comprehensive testing suite for the application's utility functions, with a specific focus on import and export operations. The tests are designed to validate the correctness of these operations and ensure the data's consistency across different export formats.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains a single subdirectory named `utils`. This subdirectory serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within `utils`, there's another subdirectory named `app`, which contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`.

### __tests__/utils

The `utils` subdirectory within the `__tests__` directory is a testing suite for the utility functions within the application. It contains a subdirectory named `app`, which houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.

#### __tests__/utils/app

The `app` subdirectory within the `utils` directory contains test files for the application's utility functions. Specifically, it includes a file named `importExports.test.ts`, which tests utility functions related to import and export operations.

##### __tests__/utils/app/importExports.test.ts

This is a test file for utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It contains tests for different versions of the export format, checking whether a given object matches the expected format for each version. It also tests the 'cleanData' function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest format.

## Key Components

The key component of the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file located in the `__tests__/utils/app` subdirectory. This file is responsible for testing the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named 'cleanData', which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house all the test files for the `chatbot-ui` project. The tests within this directory are run to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application's features and functionalities. For example, the `importExports.test.ts` file contains tests for different versions of the export format. These tests check whether a given object matches the expected format for each version. The file also tests the 'cleanData' function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest format. The tests ensure that the cleaned data matches the expected structure of the latest format.
