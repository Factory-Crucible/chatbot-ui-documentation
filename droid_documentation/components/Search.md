## `components/Search` Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a crucial part of the `chatbot-ui` project, serving as the home for the `Search` component. This component is responsible for providing a search functionality within the user interface of the chatbot. It accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' represents the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input when clicked.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two main files: `Search.tsx` and `index.ts`. 

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that exports a functional component named 'Search'. It defines the structure and behavior of the `Search` component.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the `Search` directory, exporting the default from `Search.tsx`.

### Key Components

The `Search.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the `Search` component, which is a functional component that accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.

### Usage & Examples

The `Search` component is used within the user interface of the chatbot to provide search functionality. It is a reusable component that can be imported into other parts of the codebase where a search input is required.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Search` component might be used:

```typescript
import Search from '../components/Search';

function App() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

  return (
    <Search
      placeholder="Search..."
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      onSearch={setSearchTerm}
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, the `Search` component is imported and used in a parent component. The parent component maintains the state of the search term and passes it to the `Search` component as a prop. The `onSearch` prop is a function that updates the search term in the parent component's state when the value of the search input changes.
