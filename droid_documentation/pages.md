## Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a pivotal part of the `chatbot-ui` project, serving as the home for key files and a subdirectory that are integral to the functioning of the application. This directory is responsible for defining the main entry point for the home page, setting up custom Document and App components for the Next.js application, and handling API requests and responses. The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory work in unison to provide a seamless user experience, manage state, handle API calls, and support internationalization.

### Contents

The `pages` directory is composed of three TypeScript files and an `api` subdirectory. Each file and subdirectory plays a unique role in the functioning of the application.

- `index.tsx`: Serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory.

- `_document.tsx`: Defines a custom Document for the Next.js application. It sets up an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

- `_app.tsx`: Initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.

- `api` subdirectory: Contains files for handling API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, and includes files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

The `pages` directory houses several key components that are critical to the functioning of the application.

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory.

- `_document.tsx`: This custom Document for the Next.js application defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts. It also sets the 'lang' attribute to the current locale, supporting internationalization.

- `_app.tsx`: This custom App component initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, making the application accessible to users in different languages.

- `api` subdirectory: This subdirectory is responsible for handling API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, and includes files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used in various ways within the codebase.

- `index.tsx`: This file is used as the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is used to define a custom Document for the Next.js application. It sets up an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is used to initialize pages and set up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, making the application accessible to users in different languages.

- `api` subdirectory: This subdirectory is used to handle API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, and includes files related to the 'home' page of the application.

For example, the `index.tsx` file exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory. This allows the home page of the application to be rendered on the server side, improving performance and SEO.

```typescript
export { default, getServerSideProps } from './api/home';
```

In the `_document.tsx` file, a custom Document for the Next.js application is defined. This sets up an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

```typescript
type Props = DocumentProps & {};
export default function Document(props: Props) {}
```

In the `_app.tsx` file, pages are initialized and libraries for notifications and queries are set up. It also supports internationalization, making the application accessible to users in different languages.

```typescript
function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps<{}>)
```

In the `api` subdirectory, API requests and responses are handled. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, and includes files related to the 'home' page of the application.

```typescript
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};

const handler = async (req: Request): Promise<Response> => {
};

export default handler;
```
