# `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project, each in its own subdirectory. The `components/Mobile` directory specifically contains files related to the mobile interface of the application, focusing on the navigation bar functionality. It currently houses a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component named 'Navbar'. This component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of the mobile chat application and plays a crucial role in managing the active chat conversations and initiating new ones.

## Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing a single TypeScript file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This file defines a functional component named 'Navbar' for the mobile application. The component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of a chat application. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation', which is an object of type 'Conversation', and 'onNewConversation', which is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button that, when clicked, triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

## Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the 'Navbar' functional component, which is a critical part of the mobile chat application's user interface. This component manages the display of the active chat conversation and provides the functionality to initiate new conversations. It accepts two props:

- `selectedConversation`: An object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat.
- `onNewConversation`: A function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated.

The 'Navbar' component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the 'onNewConversation' function, allowing users to start new conversations.

## Usage & Examples

The 'Navbar' component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is specifically designed for the navigation bar of the chat application, providing a user-friendly interface for managing chat conversations.

Here is a simplified example of how the 'Navbar' component might be used in the application:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The 'Navbar' component displays the name of `currentConversation` and an 'IconPlus' button that, when clicked, triggers the `handleNewConversation` function.
