# `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory plays a pivotal role in the mobile version of the application. It is dedicated to housing components that are specifically designed for the mobile interface. Currently, it contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component named `Navbar`. This component is a key part of the mobile application's user interface, serving as the navigation bar in a chat application. The `Navbar` component is designed to accept two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`, which together facilitate the display and management of active chats in the application. Despite its simplicity, this directory is crucial in ensuring a smooth and user-friendly mobile experience.

## Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing only one file and no subdirectories. The file it houses is:

- `Navbar.tsx`: A TypeScript file that defines the `Navbar` functional component. This component is used in the navigation bar of the mobile chat application. It accepts two props: `selectedConversation`, an object of type `Conversation` representing the currently active chat, and `onNewConversation`, a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated.

## Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the cornerstone of this directory. It defines the `Navbar` functional component, which is a critical part of the mobile chat application's user interface. The `Navbar` component is designed to display the name of the currently selected conversation and provide an `IconPlus` button for initiating new conversations. 

The `Navbar` component accepts two props:

- `selectedConversation`: An object of type `Conversation` that represents the currently active chat. This prop allows the `Navbar` to display the name of the active conversation.
- `onNewConversation`: A function that is triggered when the `IconPlus` button is clicked. This prop enables the initiation of new conversations from the navigation bar.

## Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component defined in the `Navbar.tsx` file is used in the mobile version of the chat application. It is typically rendered at the top of the chat interface, displaying the name of the currently active conversation and providing an `IconPlus` button for initiating new conversations.

While the exact usage may vary depending on the specific requirements of the application, a typical usage pattern might look something like this:

```typescript
<Navbar 
  selectedConversation={currentConversation} 
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation} 
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` would be an object of type `Conversation` representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` would be a function that handles the initiation of new conversations.
