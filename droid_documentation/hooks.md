## `hooks` Directory

The `hooks` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the definition and management of custom React hooks. These hooks, encapsulated within TypeScript files, provide reusable stateful logic that can be used across different components within the project. The hooks defined within this directory are `useCreateReducer` and `useFetch`, each serving a unique purpose within the application's functionality.

### Contents

The `hooks` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `useCreateReducer.ts`: This file defines a custom React hook, `useCreateReducer`, which is designed to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. It also defines two TypeScript types, `FieldNames` and `ActionType`, which are used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action.
- `useFetch.ts`: This file exports a custom React hook, `useFetch`, which is used for making HTTP requests. It defines two types, `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel`, to structure the request parameters. The hook provides methods for each HTTP verb and uses a helper function, `handleFetch`, to perform the actual fetch operation.

### Key Components

#### `useCreateReducer.ts`

The `useCreateReducer.ts` file is a critical component within the `hooks` directory. It defines the `useCreateReducer` hook, which is used to create a reducer with typed dispatch and state. This hook is particularly useful for managing complex state logic that needs to be shared across multiple components. The `FieldNames` and `ActionType` types defined within this file are used to manage the reducer's initial state and dispatch action, providing a robust and type-safe way to manage state within the application.

#### `useFetch.ts`

The `useFetch.ts` file is another key component within the `hooks` directory. It exports the `useFetch` hook, which is used for making HTTP requests. This hook is essential for any component that needs to interact with external APIs or resources. The `RequestModel` and `RequestWithBodyModel` types defined within this file provide a structured way to manage request parameters, ensuring that all HTTP requests made within the application are consistent and well-formed.

### Usage & Examples

The hooks defined within the `hooks` directory are used across various components within the application. For instance, the `useCreateReducer` hook can be used within a component to manage complex state logic. Here's a simplified example of how it might be used:

```typescript
import { useCreateReducer } from '../hooks/useCreateReducer';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

const { state, dispatch } = useCreateReducer({ initialState });

// Dispatch an action to update the state
dispatch({ type: 'increment', payload: 1 });
```

Similarly, the `useFetch` hook can be used within a component to make HTTP requests. Here's a simplified example of how it might be used:

```typescript
import { useFetch } from '../hooks/useFetch';

const { get } = useFetch();

// Make a GET request to an API
const response = await get('/api/data');
```

These examples are illustrative and may not represent the exact usage within the codebase. Always refer to the actual code for the most accurate and up-to-date usage patterns.
