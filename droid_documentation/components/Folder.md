## `components/Folder` Directory

The `components/Folder` directory is a part of the `chatbot-ui` project's component structure, specifically dedicated to the representation and functionality of a folder in a file system within the user interface. This directory contains two main files, `index.ts` and `Folder.tsx`, which together form the `Folder` component. This component is a crucial part of the project's file system representation, providing the user with the ability to interact with folders in a meaningful way, such as renaming, deleting, and handling drag and drop events.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains the following files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. This component represents a folder in a file system and includes several functionalities such as renaming, deleting, and handling drag and drop events. It uses several icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package to enhance the user interface.
- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects to simplify imports from a directory.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It exports a `Folder` component that represents a folder in a file system. The component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component renders a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the `chatbot-ui` project to represent a folder in a file system. It provides the user with the ability to interact with folders, including renaming, deleting, and handling drag and drop events. The component is used in various parts of the project where a file system representation is required.

For example, the `Folder` component might be used in a file explorer component. The file explorer would pass the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components as props to the `Folder` component. The `Folder` component would then render a button and an input field, allowing the user to open or close the folder, and rename the folder if necessary. The component would also handle drag and drop events, allowing the user to move files and folders around in the file system.

Please note that the above is a hypothetical example of how the `Folder` component might be used within the `chatbot-ui` project. The actual usage of the component may vary depending on the specific requirements and context of the project.
