## components/Spinner

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The Spinner component is defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file and is exported through the `index.ts` file for ease of import in other parts of the project.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two files:

- `index.ts`: Serves as an entry point for the Spinner component. It exports the default export from `Spinner.tsx`, simplifying imports elsewhere in the project.
- `Spinner.tsx`: Defines the Spinner component. This component displays a spinning animation and accepts 'size' and 'className' as optional props.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the Spinner component, defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file. This component is a critical part of the user interface, providing a visual indication of loading states. It is designed to be flexible, accepting optional 'size' and 'className' props to control its dimensions and styling.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate loading states. It can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` thanks to the `index.ts` file.

For example, the Spinner component might be used in a situation where data is being fetched from an API. While the data is loading, the Spinner component could be displayed to the user. Once the data has been fetched, the Spinner component would be replaced with the data.

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

function DataComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData().then(setData);
  }, []);

  if (!data) {
    return <Spinner />;
  }

  return <DataDisplay data={data} />;
}
```

In this example, the Spinner component is displayed while the `data` state is `null`. Once the data has been fetched and set to the `data` state, the Spinner component is replaced with a `DataDisplay` component that displays the fetched data.
