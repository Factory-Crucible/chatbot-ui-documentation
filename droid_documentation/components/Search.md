# `components/Search` Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a part of the larger `components` directory within the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. This directory is dedicated to the `Search` component, a functional React component written in TypeScript. The `Search` component is a key part of the user interface, providing a search input field for users to interact with. It is designed to be flexible and reusable, accepting props to customize its behavior and appearance.

## Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is the main file in the directory, containing the `Search` component. The component accepts three props: `placeholder`, `searchTerm`, and `onSearch`. The `placeholder` prop is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The `searchTerm` prop represents the current search term, and `onSearch` is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the `searchTerm` and calls `onSearch` when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling `onSearch` with an empty string.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the directory, exporting the default export from `Search.tsx`. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory.

## Key Components

The `Search.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the `Search` component, which is a functional React component that provides a search input field in the user interface. This component is designed to be flexible and reusable, accepting props to customize its behavior and appearance.

The `Search` component is a critical part of the user interface, allowing users to search for specific content or functionality within the application. It is used in various parts of the application, and its design and implementation have a significant impact on the user experience.

## Usage & Examples

The `Search` component is used in various parts of the application where a search input field is required. It is a reusable component, and its behavior and appearance can be customized through its props.

For example, the `Search` component can be used in a navigation bar to allow users to search for specific pages or content within the application. It can also be used in a settings page to allow users to search for specific settings or options.

The `Search` component is typically used like this:

```typescript
<Search
  placeholder="Search..."
  searchTerm={searchTerm}
  onSearch={handleSearch}
/>
```

In this example, `searchTerm` is a state variable that represents the current search term, and `handleSearch` is a function that updates this state variable. The `placeholder` prop is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty.
