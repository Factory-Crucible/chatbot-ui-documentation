# `utils` Directory

The `utils` directory is a crucial part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It houses a collection of utility files and subdirectories that provide various functionalities to the project. These utilities are designed to manage a wide range of tasks, from saving folders to local storage, mapping programming languages to file extensions, managing chat conversations, and handling the import and export of chatbot data. The directory is divided into three subdirectories: `app`, `server`, and `data`, each serving a specific purpose and containing relevant utility files.

## Contents

The `utils` directory contains three subdirectories: `app`, `server`, and `data`. Each subdirectory contains utility files that are specific to their respective areas of the project.

- `app`: This subdirectory contains utility files for the chatbot UI project. It includes files for managing folders, mapping programming languages to file extensions, managing chat conversations, and handling the import and export of chatbot data.
- `server`: This subdirectory provides utility functions for server-side operations. It includes an 'OpenAIError' class and a function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API. It also contains a function that standardizes text data.
- `data`: This subdirectory contains a 'throttle' function that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed.

## Key Components

The `utils` directory contains several key components that are critical to the functioning of the chatbot UI project.

- `app/const.ts`: This file defines several constants used throughout the application. These constants are primarily related to the configuration of the OpenAI API and some default settings for the chatbot.
- `app/settings.ts`: This file manages application settings. It contains functions to retrieve and save settings from and to local storage.
- `server/index.ts`: This file provides utility functions for server-side operations. It includes an 'OpenAIError' class and an 'OpenAIStream' function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API.
- `data/throttle.ts`: This file defines a generic function 'throttle' that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed.

## Usage & Examples

The utility files in the `utils` directory are used throughout the codebase to perform various tasks.

- The `app/const.ts` file is used to provide constants that are used throughout the application. For example, the `OPENAI_API_HOST` constant is used to specify the host for the OpenAI API.
- The `app/settings.ts` file is used to manage application settings. The `getSettings` function is used to retrieve the settings from local storage, and the `saveSettings` function is used to save the settings to local storage.
- The `server/index.ts` file is used to handle server-side operations. The `OpenAIStream` function is used to make POST requests to the OpenAI API.
- The `data/throttle.ts` file is used to control the rate at which a given function can be executed. This is useful for preventing excessive function calls, such as API requests, within a short period of time.
