## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. The 'Promptbar' is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. This directory contains TypeScript files and a subdirectory, each contributing to the overall functionality of the 'Promptbar' component.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory named `components`. The TypeScript files include `index.ts`, `PromptBar.context.tsx`, `Promptbar.tsx`, and `Promptbar.state.tsx`. The `index.ts` file serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the default export from the `Promptbar.tsx` file. The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. The `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file, representing the sidebar in the user interface, with functions for managing prompts and folders. The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory contains related components. These include `Prompts.tsx` which renders a list of prompts, `PromptbarSettings.tsx` which is for 'Promptbar' settings, `Prompt.tsx` which manages prompts, `PromptModal.tsx` which renders a modal for editing prompts, and `PromptFolders.tsx` which manages folders within the 'Promptbar'.

### Key Components

The `Promptbar.tsx` file is a key component in this directory. It represents the 'Promptbar' component, a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. This file uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects. It also imports several other components and contexts to handle actions like toggling the prompt bar, creating, deleting, and updating prompts, and dropping prompts into folders.

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is another critical component. It defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts. This context is used throughout the 'Promptbar' component and its subcomponents to manage state and handle actions.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory contains several important components related to the 'Promptbar' feature. These include `Prompts.tsx` which renders a list of prompts, `Prompt.tsx` which manages prompts, and `PromptFolders.tsx` which manages folders within the 'Promptbar'.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to build and manage the 'Promptbar' component of the chatbot-ui project. The 'Promptbar' component is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders.

For instance, the `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file for the 'Promptbar'. It uses the 'PromptbarContext' defined in the `PromptBar.context.tsx` file to manage state and handle actions. It also imports several other components from the `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory to provide functionalities like rendering a list of prompts (`Prompts.tsx`), managing prompts (`Prompt.tsx`), and managing folders within the 'Promptbar' (`PromptFolders.tsx`).

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file defines a context for the 'Promptbar' component. This context includes state and handlers for prompts. For example, it defines handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts. This context is used throughout the 'Promptbar' component and its subcomponents to manage state and handle actions.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory contains several components related to the 'Promptbar' feature. These components are used to provide various functionalities within the 'Promptbar'. For example, the `Prompts.tsx` component renders a list of prompts, the `Prompt.tsx` component manages prompts, and the `PromptFolders.tsx` component manages folders within the 'Promptbar'.
