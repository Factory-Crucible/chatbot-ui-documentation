## components/Folder

The `components/Folder` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the home for the `Folder` component. This component is a representation of a folder in a file system, providing a visual and interactive interface for users to manage their files. The `Folder` component is a React component written in TypeScript, and it is responsible for rendering a button and an input field, handling renaming and deleting of the folder, and managing drag and drop events. The component also uses icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package to enhance the user interface.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two main files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. The component accepts several props, maintains state, and renders a button and an input field. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this folder by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

There are no subdirectories in this directory.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It exports a `Folder` component that represents a folder in a file system. The component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component renders a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to represent a folder in a file system. It is a versatile component that can be used in various parts of the application where file management is required. The component accepts several props that allow it to be customized for different use cases.

For example, the `Folder` component can be used to represent a folder in a file explorer. The `currentFolder` prop can be passed the current folder object, the `searchTerm` prop can be passed the current search term, and the `handleDrop` prop can be passed a function to handle drag and drop events. The `folderComponent` prop can be passed a list of other `Folder` components to be rendered as children of the current folder.

```typescript
const FolderComponent = () => {
  const currentFolder = { /* folder object */ };
  const searchTerm = 'example';
  const handleDrop = (e, folder) => { /* handle drop event */ };
  const folderComponent = [ /* list of Folder components */ ];

  return (
    <Folder
      currentFolder={currentFolder}
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      handleDrop={handleDrop}
      folderComponent={folderComponent}
    />
  );
};
```

This is a simplified example and the actual usage of the `Folder` component may vary depending on the specific requirements of the application.
