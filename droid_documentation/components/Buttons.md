# `components/Buttons` Directory Documentation

The `components/Buttons` directory is a part of the `chatbot-ui` project, which serves as the user interface for a chatbot in the SF AI platform. This directory is specifically dedicated to defining and managing the various button components used across the application. The button components are encapsulated within their own subdirectories, each containing the necessary TypeScript files that define their structure, functionality, and styling. One such subdirectory is `SidebarActionButton`, which houses the `SidebarActionButton.tsx` and `index.ts` files.

## Contents

The `components/Buttons` directory contains a single subdirectory named `SidebarActionButton`. This subdirectory is dedicated to the `SidebarActionButton` component, a button with specific styling and functionality used in the application's sidebar.

- `SidebarActionButton`: This subdirectory contains two TypeScript files, `SidebarActionButton.tsx` and `index.ts`. The `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file defines the `SidebarActionButton` component, while the `index.ts` file simplifies the import paths by re-exporting the default export from `SidebarActionButton.tsx`.

## Key Components

The `SidebarActionButton` subdirectory within the `components/Buttons` directory houses the `SidebarActionButton.tsx` and `index.ts` files, which are critical to the functionality and accessibility of the `SidebarActionButton` component.

- `SidebarActionButton.tsx`: This file defines the `SidebarActionButton` component, a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`. The `handleClick` prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the `children` prop renders any child elements within the button. The button's style includes a minimum width of 20px, padding of 1, and different text colors for normal and hover states.

- `index.ts`: This file is a module export file that simplifies import paths by re-exporting the default export from `SidebarActionButton.tsx`. This practice enhances the maintainability of the codebase by simplifying the import paths for other parts of the application.

## Usage & Examples

The `SidebarActionButton` component, defined in the `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file, is used throughout the `chatbot-ui` project wherever a button with specific styling and functionality is required in the application's sidebar. The `handleClick` prop allows the component to manage the button's click event, while the `children` prop enables the rendering of any child elements within the button.

For instance, the `SidebarActionButton` might be used in a sidebar menu component as follows:

```typescript
import SidebarActionButton from '../components/Buttons/SidebarActionButton';

function SidebarMenu() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    // Handle click event
  };

  return (
    <SidebarActionButton handleClick={handleClick}>
      <Icon />
      <p>Menu Item</p>
    </SidebarActionButton>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `SidebarActionButton` component is imported from the `components/Buttons/SidebarActionButton` directory. The `handleClick` function is passed as a prop to handle the button's click event, and the `children` prop is used to render an icon and a paragraph element within the button.
