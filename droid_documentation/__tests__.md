# `__tests__` Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation project. It is a critical part of the codebase, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the code. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. Within `utils`, there's another subdirectory named `app`. The `app` subdirectory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application. It ensures that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. Additionally, it tests a function named `cleanData`, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains one subdirectory:

- `utils`: This directory serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. It contains a subdirectory named `app`, which houses a test file `importExports.test.ts` that validates the functionality of import and export operations.

## Key Components

The `__tests__` directory contains a critical file:

- `importExports.test.ts`: This file tests utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It verifies different versions of the export format, ensuring that a given object matches the expected format for each version. The file also tests the 'cleanData' function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest one, and checks that the cleaned data aligns with the expected structure of the latest format.

## Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house all the test files for the application. The `utils` subdirectory within it contains tests for utility functions, specifically within the `app` subdirectory. The `importExports.test.ts` file within the `app` subdirectory is a representative example of how these test files are structured and used.

The `importExports.test.ts` file contains several test suites, each focusing on a specific aspect of the import and export operations. For example, there are test suites for each version of the export format, checking whether a given object matches the expected format for that version. There's also a test suite for the 'cleanData' function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest one.

Here's a simplified example of what the structure of these tests might look like:

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {
    it('should return true for v1 format', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
    it('should return false for non-v1 formats', () => {
      // Test code here
    });
  });

  // Similar tests for other versions...

  describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
    describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {
      it('should return the latest format', () => {
        // Test code here
      });
    });

    // Similar tests for other versions...
  });
});
```

This structure allows for clear and organized testing of the various aspects of the import and export operations.
