## components/Chat Directory

The `components/Chat` directory houses the React components that construct the chat interface of the application. This directory is responsible for user interaction with the chat system, including message input and display, error handling, and various settings adjustments. 

### Contents

The `components/Chat` directory contains a collection of TypeScript files, each representing a unique React component. There are no subdirectories within this directory. The files include:

- `Regenerate.tsx`: The file 'Regenerate.tsx' is a React component that provides a user interface for regenerating a response when an error occurs in the chat system. It displays a fixed div at the bottom of the screen with an error message and a button. The button, when clicked, triggers the 'onRegenerate' function passed as a prop to the component. The button also contains an icon and a text that says 'Regenerate response'. The component is styled using Tailwind CSS classes.
- `PluginSelect.tsx`: Provides a dropdown selection interface for different plugins.
- `Temperature.tsx`: Provides a slider for adjusting the 'temperature' parameter in a chatbot conversation.
- `MemoizedChatMessage.tsx`: Exports a memoized version of the 'ChatMessage' component to optimize rendering.
- `ErrorMessageDiv.tsx`: Displays an error message in a structured format.
- `ModelSelect.tsx`: Provides a dropdown selection interface for different AI models.
- `ChatLoader.tsx`: Displays a loading animation for the chat interface.
- `SystemPrompt.tsx`: The file 'SystemPrompt.tsx' is a React component that handles the system prompts in a chat conversation. It takes in a conversation object, an array of prompts, and a function to change the prompt as props. It maintains several pieces of state, including the current value of the prompt, the active prompt index, whether the prompt list is visible, the prompt input value, an array of variables, and whether a modal is visible. The component defines several functions to handle changes in the prompt, select a prompt, submit updated variables, and handle keydown events. It also has effects to handle changes in the conversation prompt, resize the textarea, and handle clicks outside the prompt list.
- `VariableModal.tsx`: Provides a modal for handling variables in a chat application.
- `ChatMessage.tsx`: The 'ChatMessage.tsx' file is a React component that represents a single chat message in a chat interface. It provides functionalities to edit, delete, and copy a chat message. It also handles the display of the message based on the role of the sender (user or assistant). It includes a Markdown parser for the message content, with custom renderers for code blocks, tables, and table cells. It also includes a copy button for the message content.
- `ChatInput.tsx`: The 'ChatInput.tsx' file is a React component that provides the input functionality for a chat application. It handles changes, sends messages, stops the conversation, initializes the modal, handles key down events, parses variables, updates the prompt list visibility, selects prompts, and submits the form. It maintains several pieces of state including the content of the message, whether the user is typing, whether the prompt list is visible, the active prompt index, the prompt input value, the variables, whether the modal is visible, whether the plugin select is visible, and the selected plugin.
- `Chat.tsx`: The 'Chat.tsx' file is a React component that manages the chat functionality of the application. It handles sending messages, updating conversations, and managing responses. It also manages scrolling and message updates. It defines several functions including 'handleSend', 'scrollToBottom', 'handleScroll', 'handleScrollDown', 'handleSettings', 'onClearAll', 'scrollDown', and 'throttledScrollDown'. These functions handle various aspects of the chat functionality such as sending messages, managing conversations, scrolling, and managing settings.
- `PromptList.tsx`: Renders a list of prompts.

### Usage & Examples

It uses the `ChatInput.tsx` component for user input and the `ChatMessage.tsx` component for displaying each message in the conversation.
