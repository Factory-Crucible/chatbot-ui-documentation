## components/Folder

The `components/Folder` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project. It houses the `Folder` component, a React component that represents a folder in a file system. This component is a key part of the user interface, allowing users to interact with folders in the chatbot's file system. The `Folder` component is responsible for rendering a button and an input field, handling renaming and deleting of the folder, and managing drag and drop events. It uses icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package to enhance the user interface.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two main files: `Folder.tsx` and `index.ts`.

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. The `Folder` component represents a folder in a file system and includes several handlers for managing the folder's state and user interactions.
- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this folder by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is a critical component in this directory. It exports a single component, `Folder`, which represents a folder in a file system. The `Folder` component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component renders a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to represent folders in the file system. It is a key part of the user interface, allowing users to interact with folders in a seamless and efficient manner.

For example, when a user wants to rename a folder, they can click on the folder's name, which will trigger the `Folder` component's renaming handler. This handler will update the component's state, causing it to render an input field where the user can enter the new name. Once the user has entered the new name and pressed enter, the `Folder` component will update the folder's name and render the updated name.

Similarly, when a user wants to delete a folder, they can click on the delete icon, which will trigger the `Folder` component's deleting handler. This handler will update the component's state, causing it to render a confirmation dialog. If the user confirms the deletion, the `Folder` component will delete the folder and update the user interface accordingly.

The `Folder` component also handles drag and drop events, allowing users to move folders around in the file system. When a user drags a folder over another folder, the `Folder` component's drop handler will be triggered. This handler will move the dragged folder into the target folder and update the user interface to reflect the new file system structure.
