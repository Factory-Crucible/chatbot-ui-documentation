## Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a pivotal part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the home for key files and subdirectories that define the structure and behavior of the application's pages. This directory is a unique feature of Next.js applications, where each file corresponds to a route in the application. The files in this directory are responsible for rendering the user interface of the application, handling server-side rendering, and managing API requests and responses. The `pages` directory is organized into several files and a subdirectory named `api`, which further contains files and a subdirectory related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Contents

The `pages` directory contains three TypeScript files and a subdirectory:

- `index.tsx`: This file serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function.
- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.
- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api`: This subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

The `pages` directory contains several key components that play a crucial role in the functioning of the chatbot-ui application:

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from a sibling file in the 'api' subdirectory named 'home'.
- `_document.tsx`: This file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts. This is essential for the proper rendering and functioning of the application.
- `_app.tsx`: This file is a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, making the application accessible to a global audience.
- `api`: This subdirectory is responsible for handling API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, and contains files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used to define the structure and behavior of the application's pages. For instance, the `index.tsx` file serves as the main entry point for the application's home page. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, both of which are imported from a sibling file in the 'api' subdirectory named 'home'. This is a typical usage pattern in Next.js applications, where each file in the `pages` directory corresponds to a route in the application.

The `_document.tsx` file is a custom Document for the Next.js application. It defines an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts. This is essential for the proper rendering and functioning of the application. The `_app.tsx` file is a custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization, making the application accessible to a global audience.

The `api` subdirectory is responsible for handling API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, and contains files related to the 'home' page of the application. This subdirectory is a crucial part of the application, as it manages the interactions between the application and external APIs.
