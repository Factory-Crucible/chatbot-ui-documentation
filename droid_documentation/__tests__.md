# `__tests__` Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the `chatbot-ui` project. It is a crucial part of the codebase, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the code. The directory is structured to mirror the application's structure, allowing for a clear and organized testing approach. The tests within this directory validate the functionality of various aspects of the application, including utility functions and import/export operations.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains a single subdirectory named `utils`. This subdirectory serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. It contains another subdirectory named `app`, which houses a test file named `importExports.test.ts`.

### `__tests__/utils`

The `__tests__/utils` directory is a testing suite for utility functions within the application. It contains a subdirectory named `app`, which houses a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file validates the functionality of import and export operations, ensuring that exported objects align with the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

#### `__tests__/utils/app`

The `__tests__/utils/app` directory contains a single test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file tests utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It verifies different versions of the export format, ensuring that a given object matches the expected format for each version. The file also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest one.

##### `__tests__/utils/app/importExports.test.ts`

The `importExports.test.ts` file is a test file for utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It contains tests for different versions of the export format, checking whether a given object matches the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest format.

## Key Components

The key component in the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file. This file tests the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which is designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one. The test verifies that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used to house all the tests for the application. The tests within this directory are run to validate the functionality of various aspects of the application, including utility functions and import/export operations.

For example, the `importExports.test.ts` file contains tests for different versions of the export format. These tests check whether a given object matches the expected format for each version. Here is a simplified example of what these tests might look like:

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {
  describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {
    it('should return true for v1 format', () => {
      // Test logic here
    });
    it('should return false for non-v1 formats', () => {
      // Test logic here
    });
  });
  // Other format tests...
});
```

The file also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest format. Here is a simplified example of what these tests might look like:

```typescript
describe('cleanData Functions', () => {
  describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {
    it('should return the latest format', () => {
      // Test logic here
    });
  });
  // Other cleaning tests...
});
```

These examples are representative of the typical usage patterns within the `__tests__` directory.
