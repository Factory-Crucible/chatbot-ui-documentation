## pages
The `pages` directory is a critical part of the project, containing key files and a subdirectory. It includes the main entry point for the home page, a custom Document for the Next.js application, a custom App component, and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests and responses.

### Contents
The `pages` directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

- `index.tsx`: Serves as the main entry point for the home page, exporting a React component and a server-side rendering function.
- `_document.tsx`: A custom Document for the Next.js application, defining an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.
- `_app.tsx`: A custom App component, initializing pages and setting up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api`: A subdirectory containing files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components
- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page, exporting a React component and a server-side rendering function.
- `_document.tsx`: This file defines a custom Document for the Next.js application, providing an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts.
- `_app.tsx`: This file initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.
- `api`: This subdirectory handles API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Usage & Examples
The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used to define the structure and functionality of the application's pages. For example, `index.tsx` is the main entry point for the home page, exporting a React component and a server-side rendering function. The `_document.tsx` file defines a custom Document for the Next.js application, providing an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts. The `_app.tsx` file initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries, and also supports internationalization. The `api` subdirectory contains files for handling API requests and responses, interacting with OpenAI and Google APIs, and files related to the 'home' page of the application.
