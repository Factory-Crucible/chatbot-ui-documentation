# `__tests__` Directory

The `__tests__` directory is a dedicated space for testing in the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation project. It is a crucial part of the project's engineering practices, ensuring the reliability and maintainability of the codebase. The directory contains a subdirectory named `utils`, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. The `utils` subdirectory further contains an `app` subdirectory, which houses a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file is responsible for validating the import and export operations of the application.

## Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- `utils`: A subdirectory that serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. It contains an `app` subdirectory, which houses a test file named `importExports.test.ts`.

### `utils` Subdirectory

The `utils` subdirectory within the `__tests__` directory is a testing suite for the application's utility functions. It contains an `app` subdirectory, which houses a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file validates the functionality of import and export operations, ensuring that exported objects align with the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

#### `app` Subdirectory

The `app` subdirectory within the `utils` directory contains a test file named `importExports.test.ts`. This file tests utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It verifies different versions of the export format, ensuring that a given object matches the expected format for each version. The file also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest one.

##### `importExports.test.ts` File

The `importExports.test.ts` file is a test file for utility functions related to import and export operations in the application. It contains tests for different versions of the export format, checking whether a given object matches the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which converts data from older export formats to the latest format.

## Key Components

The key component in the `__tests__` directory is the `importExports.test.ts` file. This file is critical because it validates the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one, ensuring that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

## Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used for testing the application's utility functions. The `importExports.test.ts` file, for example, tests the import and export operations of the application. It verifies that a given object matches the expected format for each version and tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

Here is a skeleton of the `importExports.test.ts` file:

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {});
it('should return true for v1 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v1 formats', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV2', () => {});
it('should return true for v2 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v2 formats', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV3', () => {});
it('should return true for v3 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v3 formats', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV4', () => {});
it('should return true for v4 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v4 formats', () => {});
describe('cleanData Functions', () => {});
describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {});
it('should return the latest format', () => {});
describe('cleaning v2 data', () => {});
it('should return the latest format', () => {});
describe('cleaning v4 data', () => {});
it('should return the latest format', () => {});
```

This skeleton represents the structure of the tests in the `importExports.test.ts` file. Each `describe` block groups related tests, and each `it` block contains a single test. The tests verify the functionality of the import and export operations and the `cleanData` function.
