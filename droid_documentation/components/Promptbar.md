## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. The 'Promptbar' is a sidebar in the user interface, responsible for managing prompts and folders. It is a React component, written in TypeScript, and is structured into several files and a subdirectory. The files include 'index.ts', 'PromptBar.context.tsx', 'Promptbar.tsx', and 'Promptbar.state.tsx'. The subdirectory 'components/Promptbar/components' contains related components such as 'Prompts.tsx', 'PromptbarSettings.tsx', 'Prompt.tsx', 'PromptModal.tsx', and 'PromptFolders.tsx'. 

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory is structured into four TypeScript files and one subdirectory. 

- `index.ts`: Serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the component for use in other parts of the application.
- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: Defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: The main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: Defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.
- `components/Promptbar/components`: A subdirectory containing related components.

### Key Components

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several key files and components that contribute to the functionality of the 'Promptbar' feature.

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This file is critical as it defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component. It outlines the shape of the context, including the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file for the 'Promptbar'. It represents a sidebar in the UI and includes functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `components/Promptbar/components/Prompt.tsx`: This component handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and manages local state for various functionalities.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to manage the 'Promptbar' feature of the chatbot-ui application.

- `PromptBar.context.tsx` is used to provide a context for the 'Promptbar' component. This context is then used in other parts of the application to access and manipulate the state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx` is used to render the 'Promptbar' component in the user interface. It uses the 'PromptbarContext' to dispatch actions and handle updates and deletions of prompts.
- The components in the `components/Promptbar/components` directory are used to render various parts of the 'Promptbar' feature. For example, 'Prompts.tsx' is used to display a list of prompts, 'Prompt.tsx' is used to manage individual prompts, and 'PromptFolders.tsx' is used to manage folders within the 'Promptbar'.
