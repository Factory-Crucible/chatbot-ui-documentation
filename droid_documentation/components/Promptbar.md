## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the codebase for the 'Promptbar' feature of the application. The 'Promptbar' is a sidebar in the user interface that provides functionalities for managing prompts and folders. This directory contains TypeScript files that define the structure, state, and context of the 'Promptbar' component. It also includes a subdirectory named 'components' that houses related components such as 'Prompts', 'PromptbarSettings', 'Prompt', 'PromptModal', and 'PromptFolders'.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the default export from the 'Promptbar.tsx' file.

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts.

- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file for the 'Promptbar', representing a sidebar in the UI with functions for managing prompts and folders.

- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.

- `components`: This subdirectory contains related components such as 'Prompts', 'PromptbarSettings', 'Prompt', 'PromptModal', and 'PromptFolders'.

### Key Components

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several key components that contribute to the functionality of the 'Promptbar':

- `Promptbar.tsx`: This file is the main component file for the 'Promptbar'. It uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects, and imports several other components and contexts. It also defines several functions to handle actions like toggling the prompt bar, creating, deleting, and updating prompts, and dropping prompts into folders.

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This context file is crucial as it provides the state and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts, which are essential functionalities of the 'Promptbar'.

- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file is important as it defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component, providing a blueprint for the state structure of the 'Promptbar'.

- `components/Prompt.tsx`: This component file is key as it handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and manages local state for various functionalities.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subfolders within the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to build and manage the 'Promptbar' feature of the chatbot-ui application. 

For instance, the `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file for the 'Promptbar'. It uses the 'PromptbarContext' and 'Promptbar.state' to manage state and effects, and defines several functions to handle actions like toggling the prompt bar, creating, deleting, and updating prompts, and dropping prompts into folders.

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component. It outlines the shape of the context, including the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts. This context is then used in other parts of the application, such as in the 'Prompt' component to dispatch actions and handle updates and deletions of prompts.

The `components` subdirectory contains several related components. For example, the 'Prompts.tsx' component renders a list of prompts, the 'Prompt.tsx' component handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and the 'PromptFolders.tsx' component handles the display and functionality of folders within the 'Promptbar', including the dropping of prompts into folders.
