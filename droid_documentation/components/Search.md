## `components/Search` Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the home for the Search component. This component is a functional React component written in TypeScript, designed to provide a search input field for the user interface. The Search component is a key part of the user interface, allowing users to input search terms and interact with the chatbot-ui in a more dynamic and responsive manner.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two main files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that exports a functional component named 'Search'. The component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.

- `index.ts`: This is a simple TypeScript file that exports the default export from the sibling file 'Search.tsx'. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory. In this case, any other parts of the code that import from the 'Search' directory will automatically receive the default export from 'Search.tsx'.

### Key Components

The `Search.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the Search component, which is a functional React component that provides a search input field in the user interface. The component accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch', which control the behavior and appearance of the search input field. The 'Search.tsx' file is crucial because it defines the structure and functionality of the Search component, which is a key part of the user interface.

### Usage & Examples

The Search component is used in various parts of the chatbot-ui project to provide a search input field. It is imported from the 'Search' directory, which automatically provides the default export from 'Search.tsx' due to the 'index.ts' file.

The Search component is typically used with three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' prop is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' prop is the current search term, and the 'onSearch' prop is a function that updates the search term.

Here is a simplified example of how the Search component might be used:

```typescript
import Search from 'components/Search';

function App() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

  return (
    <Search
      placeholder="Search..."
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      onSearch={setSearchTerm}
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, the Search component is used in a parent component (e.g., 'App'). The 'searchTerm' state is managed in the parent component, and the 'setSearchTerm' function is passed to the Search component via the 'onSearch' prop. This allows the Search component to update the 'searchTerm' state in the parent component when the user inputs a new search term.
