## `components/Folder` Directory

The `components/Folder` directory is a part of the `chatbot-ui` project's component structure, specifically designed to handle the representation and interaction of a folder in a file system within the user interface. This directory contains two main files, `index.ts` and `Folder.tsx`, which work together to provide a reusable `Folder` component. This component is integral to the project as it provides the user with the ability to interact with folders, including renaming, deleting, and handling drag and drop events.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory is composed of two TypeScript files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. This component represents a folder in a file system and includes several functionalities such as renaming, deleting, and handling drag and drop events.

- `index.ts`: This file simplifies imports from the `components/Folder` directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects to simplify imports.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is a critical part of the `components/Folder` directory. It exports a `Folder` component that represents a folder in a file system. This component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component renders a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The component uses several icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the `chatbot-ui` project to represent and interact with a folder in a file system. It is a reusable component that can be imported into other parts of the project where folder interaction is required. 

For instance, the `Folder` component might be used in a file explorer feature of the application. Here, the `Folder` component would be responsible for rendering each folder in the file system, allowing users to open and close folders, rename folders, and drag and drop files or other folders into the folder.

The `Folder` component is typically used with several props. For example:

```typescript
<Folder
  currentFolder={currentFolder}
  searchTerm={searchTerm}
  handleDrop={handleDrop}
  folderComponent={folderComponent}
/>
```

In this example, `currentFolder` is the folder that the `Folder` component represents, `searchTerm` is a string that is used to filter the contents of the folder, `handleDrop` is a function that handles a file or folder being dropped onto the `Folder` component, and `folderComponent` is a list of components that are rendered inside the `Folder` component when it is open.
