## `components/Folder` Directory

The `components/Folder` directory is a part of the chatbot-ui project's component structure, specifically designed to represent a folder in a file system within the user interface. This directory contains two main files: `Folder.tsx` and `index.ts`. The `Folder.tsx` file is a React component that encapsulates the functionality and presentation of a folder in the chatbot's file system. The `index.ts` file simplifies the import process from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file. This directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains the following files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. This component represents a folder in a file system and includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. It uses several icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package.
- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this directory by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is a critical component in this directory. It exports a `Folder` component that represents a folder in a file system. This component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component renders a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The component uses several icons from the '@tabler/icons-react' package.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the chatbot-ui project to represent a folder in a file system. It is a part of the user interface and is responsible for handling user interactions related to folders, such as opening and closing folders, renaming folders, and deleting folders. It also handles drag and drop events for folders.

For example, the `Folder` component might be used in a file explorer component to render a list of folders. Each `Folder` component would be passed the current folder data, a search term for filtering the list of folders, a drop handler for handling drag and drop events, and a list of folder components for rendering nested folders.

```typescript
const FolderList = ({ folders, searchTerm, handleDrop }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {folders.map((folder) => (
        <Folder
          key={folder.id}
          currentFolder={folder}
          searchTerm={searchTerm}
          handleDrop={handleDrop}
          folderComponent={folder.children.map((childFolder) => (
            <Folder
              key={childFolder.id}
              currentFolder={childFolder}
              searchTerm={searchTerm}
              handleDrop={handleDrop}
            />
          ))}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the `FolderList` component renders a list of `Folder` components. Each `Folder` component is passed the current folder data, the search term, and the drop handler. The `folderComponent` prop is a list of `Folder` components for rendering nested folders.
