## `components/Buttons` Directory

The `components/Buttons` directory is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the chatbot-ui project. Specifically, the `components/Buttons` directory is dedicated to defining and managing the different types of buttons used across the user interface of the chatbot. These buttons are integral to the user interaction with the chatbot, enabling actions such as sending messages, opening and closing modals, and navigating through the chatbot's features.

### Contents

The `components/Buttons` directory contains a single subdirectory named `SidebarActionButton`. This subdirectory is dedicated to a specific type of button used in the sidebar of the chatbot user interface. The `SidebarActionButton` subdirectory contains two files: `index.ts` and `SidebarActionButton.tsx`.

- `SidebarActionButton` Subdirectory: This subdirectory houses the `SidebarActionButton` component, a button with specific styling and functionality used in the sidebar of the chatbot user interface. The `SidebarActionButton` component is defined in the `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file and re-exported in the `index.ts` file for simplified import paths.

### Key Components

The key component in the `components/Buttons` directory is the `SidebarActionButton` component, defined in the `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file within the `SidebarActionButton` subdirectory. This component is a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`.

- `SidebarActionButton.tsx`: This file defines the `SidebarActionButton` component. This button has a minimum width of 20px, padding of 1, and different text colors for normal and hover states. The `handleClick` prop is a function that handles the button's click event, while the `children` prop is used to render any child elements within the button.

### Usage & Examples

The `SidebarActionButton` component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project wherever a button with its specific styling and functionality is needed in the sidebar of the user interface. The `handleClick` prop allows for custom click event handling, making the component versatile for various use cases.

For instance, a `SidebarActionButton` might be used to toggle a settings modal in the sidebar. The `handleClick` prop would be passed a function that toggles the state of the modal, and the `children` prop would render the text or icon for the settings button.

While the exact usage of the `SidebarActionButton` component can vary depending on the specific needs of the feature it is used in, a typical usage might look like this:

```tsx
<SidebarActionButton handleClick={toggleSettingsModal}>
  <SettingsIcon />
</SidebarActionButton>
```

In this example, `toggleSettingsModal` is a function that toggles the state of a settings modal, and `<SettingsIcon />` is a child component that renders an icon for the settings button.
