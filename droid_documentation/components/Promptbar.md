## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the React application, housing TypeScript files and a subdirectory that together form the 'Promptbar' component. This component represents a sidebar in the user interface, providing functions for managing prompts and folders. The 'Promptbar' component is a complex feature of the application, with its state and context defined in separate files, and related components housed in a dedicated subdirectory.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains five files and one subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the default export from the 'Promptbar.tsx' file.
- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This TypeScript context file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.
- `components/Promptbar/components`: This subdirectory contains related components to the 'Promptbar' component.

### Key Components

The `components/Promptbar` directory houses several key files and components:

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This context file is critical as it outlines the shape of the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This file is the heart of the 'Promptbar' component, managing the state and effects, and rendering the user interface of the sidebar.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file is essential for defining the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component, setting the groundwork for state management within the component.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to build and manage the 'Promptbar' component of the application. For instance, the `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is used to provide a context for the 'Promptbar' component, which can be consumed by child components to access the state and dispatch function. The `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file, using the context and state to render the sidebar and handle user interactions.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory contains related components that are used within the 'Promptbar' component. For example, the `Prompt.tsx` file exports a 'PromptComponent' that handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and manages local state for various functionalities. The `PromptFolders.tsx` file exports a component that handles the display and functionality of folders within the 'Promptbar', including the dropping of prompts into folders.

While the skeleton code provided does not fully represent typical usage patterns, it gives an idea of how these files and components are structured and used within the codebase.
