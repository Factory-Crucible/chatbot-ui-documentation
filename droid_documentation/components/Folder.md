## components/Folder

The `components/Folder` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project. It houses the `Folder` component, a React component that represents a folder in a file system. This component is integral to the user interface of the chatbot, providing a visual representation of a folder and enabling user interactions such as renaming, deleting, and handling drag and drop events. The `Folder` component is a key part of the project's modular architecture, fitting into the larger structure of the `components` directory.

### Contents

The `components/Folder` directory contains two main files:

- `Folder.tsx`: This is a React component file that exports a single component, `Folder`. The `Folder` component represents a folder in a file system, accepting several props and maintaining state. It renders a button and an input field, and includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events. The component uses icons from the `@tabler/icons-react` package.

- `index.ts`: This is a TypeScript file that simplifies imports from this folder by exporting the default export from the `Folder.tsx` file. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects to simplify imports from a directory.

### Key Components

The `Folder.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It exports the `Folder` component, which is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui's user interface. The `Folder` component accepts several props, including the current folder, a search term, a drop handler, and a list of folder components. It maintains several pieces of state, including whether it is being deleted or renamed, the new name if it is being renamed, and whether it is open or closed. The component renders a button that can be clicked to open or close the folder, and an input field for renaming the folder. It also includes handlers for renaming and deleting the folder, as well as for drag and drop events.

### Usage & Examples

The `Folder` component is used within the chatbot-ui project to represent a folder in a file system. It is used in various parts of the application where a visual representation of a folder is needed, and where user interactions with folders are required.

For example, the `Folder` component might be used in a file explorer feature of the application. The component would be rendered for each folder in the file system, and the user could interact with the folders by clicking on them to open or close them, dragging and dropping files into them, or renaming or deleting them.

The `Folder` component is typically used by passing in the necessary props and rendering it within a parent component. Here is a simplified example of how it might be used:

```typescript
import Folder from './components/Folder';

// ...

<Folder
  currentFolder={currentFolder}
  searchTerm={searchTerm}
  handleDrop={handleDrop}
  folderComponent={folderComponent}
/>
```

In this example, `currentFolder` is the folder that the `Folder` component represents, `searchTerm` is a string that the user has entered to search for files or folders, `handleDrop` is a function that handles drag and drop events, and `folderComponent` is a list of other `Folder` components that are children of the current folder.
