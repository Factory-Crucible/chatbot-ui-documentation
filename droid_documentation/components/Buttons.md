## components/Buttons Directory

The `components/Buttons` directory is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the chatbot-ui project. This specific directory, `components/Buttons`, is dedicated to defining and managing the various buttons used throughout the user interface of the chatbot. It contains a subdirectory named `SidebarActionButton` which houses two files: `index.ts` and `SidebarActionButton.tsx`. These files define a React component named 'SidebarActionButton', a button with specific styling and two props: 'handleClick' and 'children'. The 'handleClick' prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the 'children' prop renders any child elements within the button. The button's style includes a minimum width of 20px, padding of 1, and different text colors for normal and hover states.

### Contents

The `components/Buttons` directory contains one subdirectory:

- `SidebarActionButton`: This subdirectory contains two files, `index.ts` and `SidebarActionButton.tsx`, which define the 'SidebarActionButton' React component. This component is a button with specific styling and two props: 'handleClick' and 'children'. The 'handleClick' prop is a function that handles the button's click event, while the 'children' prop is used to render any child elements within the button.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `SidebarActionButton` React component, defined in the `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file. This component is a button with specific styling and two props: 'handleClick' and 'children'. The 'handleClick' prop is a function that handles the button's click event, while the 'children' prop is used to render any child elements within the button. This button is used throughout the chatbot-ui project, providing a consistent look and feel for button elements and ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Usage & Examples

The `SidebarActionButton` component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project wherever a button with specific styling is required. The 'handleClick' prop is used to manage the button's click event, allowing the button to perform specific actions when clicked. The 'children' prop is used to render any child elements within the button, providing flexibility in the button's content.

For example, the `SidebarActionButton` might be used in a sidebar menu to navigate between different sections of the chatbot. The 'handleClick' prop could be used to change the active section when the button is clicked, and the 'children' prop could be used to render the name of the section within the button.

```typescript
<SidebarActionButton handleClick={changeActiveSection}>
  {sectionName}
</SidebarActionButton>
```

This example demonstrates a typical usage of the `SidebarActionButton` component. The 'handleClick' prop is set to a function that changes the active section, and the 'children' prop is set to the name of the section. This creates a button that changes the active section when clicked and displays the name of the section within the button.
