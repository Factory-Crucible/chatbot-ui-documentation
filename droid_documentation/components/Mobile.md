# `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project, each in its own subdirectory. The `components/Mobile` directory specifically contains files related to the mobile interface of the application, focusing on the navigation bar functionality. The directory currently houses one TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component named 'Navbar'. This component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of the mobile chat application, and it plays a crucial role in managing the active chat and initiating new conversations.

## Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is a single-layered directory with no subdirectories. It contains one TypeScript file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This file defines a functional component named 'Navbar' for the mobile application. The component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of a chat application. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation', which is an object of type 'Conversation', and 'onNewConversation', which is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button that, when clicked, triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

## Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the 'Navbar' functional component, which is specifically designed for the mobile application's navigation bar. The 'Navbar' component plays a crucial role in managing the active chat and initiating new conversations in the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It accepts two props:

- `selectedConversation`: An object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat.
- `onNewConversation`: A function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated.

The 'Navbar' component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the 'onNewConversation' function, thus initiating a new conversation.

## Usage & Examples

The 'Navbar' component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a part of the navigation bar and is responsible for displaying the currently active chat and providing the functionality to start a new conversation.

Here is a simplified example of how the 'Navbar' component might be used in the application:

```typescript
import { Navbar } from './components/Mobile/Navbar';

const App = () => {
  const [selectedConversation, setSelectedConversation] = useState<Conversation>(null);

  const handleNewConversation = () => {
    // Logic to start a new conversation
  };

  return (
    <Navbar
      selectedConversation={selectedConversation}
      onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example, the 'Navbar' component is imported from the 'components/Mobile' directory and used in the 'App' component. The 'selectedConversation' state is managed by the 'App' component, and the 'handleNewConversation' function is passed as a prop to the 'Navbar' component. When the 'IconPlus' button in the 'Navbar' component is clicked, it triggers the 'handleNewConversation' function, initiating a new conversation.
