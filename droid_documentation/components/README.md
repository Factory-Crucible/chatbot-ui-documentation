# Directory Overview: components

The `components` directory is a central part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. It houses the various React components that collectively form the user interface of the chatbot application. Each subdirectory within `components` corresponds to a specific part of the user interface, such as the chat bar, settings dialog, or sidebar. These components are designed to be modular and reusable, allowing for efficient development and maintenance of the chatbot UI. The components interact with each other and with the application's state to provide a seamless and efficient user experience.

## Contents

The `components` directory is a collection of subdirectories, each representing a distinct part of the chatbot UI. For instance, the `Markdown` subdirectory contains components for rendering markdown content and displaying code blocks, while the `Buttons` subdirectory houses components for various types of buttons used across the application. The `Search` subdirectory is dedicated to the search functionality, and the `Settings` subdirectory manages the application's settings. The `Chat` subdirectory houses components that form the chat interface, and the `Chatbar` subdirectory manages the chat bar. The `Spinner` subdirectory contains a component for indicating loading states, and the `Sidebar` subdirectory houses the logic and structure for the sidebar. The `Promptbar` subdirectory manages the 'Promptbar' feature, and the `Folder` subdirectory represents a folder in a file system within the UI. Lastly, the `Mobile` subdirectory is dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot UI.

These subdirectories work together to form the complete chatbot UI. Each subdirectory contains TypeScript files defining the components and their functionalities, along with an `index.ts` file that exports the main component for use in other parts of the application. Some subdirectories also contain additional subdirectories for related components.

## Structure

The `components` directory is structured into several subdirectories, each serving a specific purpose in the chatbot UI. Here is a high-level overview of these subdirectories:

- [`Markdown`](./Markdown.md): Handles markdown rendering within the chatbot UI.
- [`Buttons`](./Buttons.md): Defines and manages the different types of buttons used across the user interface.
- [`Search`](./Search.md): Dedicated to the search functionality within the chatbot user interface.
- [`Settings`](./Settings.md): Manages the application's settings.
- [`Chat`](./Chat.md): Houses the React components that collectively form the chat interface.
- [`Chatbar`](./Chatbar.md): Manages the chat bar.
- [`Spinner`](./Spinner.md): Provides a visual indication of loading states throughout the application.
- [`Sidebar`](./Sidebar.md): Handles the logic and structure for the sidebar.
- [`Promptbar`](./Promptbar.md): Manages the 'Promptbar' feature of the application.
- [`Folder`](./Folder.md): Represents and manages a folder in a file system within the user interface.
- [`Mobile`](./Mobile.md): Dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot user interface.

Each subdirectory contains a detailed documentation file that provides an in-depth overview of the subdirectory's contents, key components, and usage examples. These documentation files can be accessed by clicking on the subdirectory names above.
