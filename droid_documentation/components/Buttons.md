## `components/Buttons` Directory

The `components/Buttons` directory is a dedicated space for the button components used across the `chatbot-ui` project. It is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project, each in its own subdirectory. The `Buttons` directory specifically contains a subdirectory named `SidebarActionButton` which defines a React component of the same name. This component is a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`. The `handleClick` prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the `children` prop renders any child elements within the button. The button's style includes a minimum width of 20px, padding of 1, and different text colors for normal and hover states.

### Contents

The `components/Buttons` directory contains a single subdirectory:

- `SidebarActionButton`: This subdirectory houses two files: `index.ts` and `SidebarActionButton.tsx`. The `index.ts` file is a module export file that simplifies import paths by re-exporting the default export from `SidebarActionButton.tsx`. The `SidebarActionButton.tsx` file defines the `SidebarActionButton` React component.

### Key Components

The `SidebarActionButton` component is a key element within the `components/Buttons` directory. This component is a button with specific styling and two props: `handleClick` and `children`. The `handleClick` prop is a function that manages the button's click event, and the `children` prop renders any child elements within the button. The button's style includes a minimum width of 20px, padding of 1, and different text colors for normal and hover states.

### Usage & Examples

The `SidebarActionButton` component is used across the `chatbot-ui` project wherever a button with the specific styling and functionality is required. The `handleClick` prop allows the component to be versatile and adaptable to different contexts, as it can be passed any function that should be executed on the button's click event. The `children` prop allows for flexibility in what is rendered within the button, making it a reusable and adaptable component.

For example, a `SidebarActionButton` might be used to toggle the visibility of a sidebar in the application. The `handleClick` prop could be passed a function that toggles a piece of state representing whether the sidebar is visible or not. The `children` prop could be passed a `<span>` element containing the text "Toggle Sidebar".

Please note that the above is a hypothetical example and may not represent the actual usage within the `chatbot-ui` codebase.
