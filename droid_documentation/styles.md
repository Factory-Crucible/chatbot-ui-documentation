## Styles Directory

The `styles` directory serves as the central hub for global styling within the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation codebase. It is responsible for defining the overall look and feel of the application, ensuring a consistent user experience across different components and modules. The directory contains a single file, `globals.css`, which holds the global styles for the project. This file is crucial in maintaining the visual consistency of the application, as it defines the base styles that are applied throughout the project.

### Contents

The `styles` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing only one file:

- `globals.css`: This is a CSS file that holds the global styles for the project. It is responsible for setting the base styles that are applied throughout the application.

### Key Components

The `globals.css` file is the key component within the `styles` directory. It is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file that contains global styles for the project. It includes the import of base, components, and utilities from Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The file also contains custom styles for the webkit scrollbar, including its track, thumb, and corner, with different styles for hover states. It sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade. Additionally, it contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Lastly, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file is used to define the global styles that are applied throughout the application. It is imported into the main application file, where its styles are applied to the entire project. The file is written in CSS, a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.

For example, the file includes an import statement for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss/base';
@import 'tailwindcss/components';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';
```

It also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar:

```css
::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 12px;
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  background: #1a1a1a;
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: #888;
  border-radius: 20px;
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover {
  background: #555;
}
```

These styles are applied to the scrollbar in webkit-based browsers, customizing its appearance to match the overall look and feel of the application.
