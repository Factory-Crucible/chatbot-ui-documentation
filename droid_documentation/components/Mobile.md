## `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot user interface. It currently contains a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, which defines a functional component for the mobile application's navigation bar. This directory is crucial in ensuring that the chatbot UI is responsive and accessible on mobile devices, providing a seamless user experience across different platforms.

### Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing only one file:

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines the `Navbar` functional component, which is specifically designed for the mobile application's navigation bar. It is responsible for displaying the currently active chat and providing an interface for initiating new conversations.

### Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the `Navbar` functional component, which is a critical part of the mobile chatbot UI. This component is responsible for displaying the currently active chat and providing an interface for initiating new conversations. It accepts two props: `selectedConversation` and `onNewConversation`. The `selectedConversation` prop is an object of type `Conversation` representing the currently active chat, while the `onNewConversation` prop is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started.

### Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component is used within the mobile version of the chatbot UI. It is responsible for displaying the currently active chat and providing an interface for initiating new conversations. Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object of type `Conversation` representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. When the `IconPlus` button within the `Navbar` component is clicked, it triggers the `handleNewConversation` function, initiating a new conversation.

Please note that this is a simplified example and the actual usage of the `Navbar` component may vary depending on the context and the specific requirements of the chatbot UI.
