## Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a pivotal part of the chatbot-ui project, serving as the container for key files and a subdirectory that are integral to the functionality of the application. This directory is responsible for defining the main entry point for the home page, setting up the custom Document and App components for the Next.js application, and handling API requests and responses. The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory work in unison to provide a seamless user interface and efficient server-side rendering, making it a crucial part of the project's architecture.

### Contents

The `pages` directory is composed of three TypeScript files and an `api` subdirectory. Each file and subdirectory plays a specific role in the functioning of the application:

- `index.tsx`: Serves as the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory.

- `_document.tsx`: Defines a custom Document for the Next.js application. It sets up an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

- `_app.tsx`: Initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It also supports internationalization.

- `api` subdirectory: Contains files for handling API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, and includes files related to the 'home' page of the application.

### Key Components

The `pages` directory houses several key components that are critical to the functioning of the chatbot-ui project:

- `index.tsx`: This file is the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, which are crucial for rendering the home page and handling server-side operations.

- `_document.tsx`: This custom Document for the Next.js application defines the structure of the HTML document, including metadata and scripts. It plays a vital role in setting up the HTML document structure for the application and supporting internationalization.

- `_app.tsx`: This custom App component initializes pages and sets up libraries for notifications and queries. It is essential for initializing the application and setting up key functionalities.

- `api` subdirectory: This subdirectory is responsible for handling API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, making it a key component in the data flow and interactions of the application.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories within the `pages` directory are used in various ways within the codebase:

- `index.tsx`: This file is used as the main entry point for the home page of the application. It exports a React component and a server-side rendering function, which are used to render the home page and handle server-side operations.

- `_document.tsx`: This file is used to define a custom Document for the Next.js application. It sets up an HTML document structure with metadata and scripts, and supports internationalization.

- `_app.tsx`: This file is used to initialize pages and set up libraries for notifications and queries. It is used to initialize the application and set up key functionalities.

- `api` subdirectory: This subdirectory is used to handle API requests and responses. It interacts with OpenAI and Google APIs, and includes files related to the 'home' page of the application.

For example, the `index.tsx` file exports a React component and a server-side rendering function from the `home` file in the `api` subdirectory. This is representative of the typical usage pattern of this file in the codebase.
