## components/Spinner

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The Spinner component is a crucial part of the user experience, providing feedback to the user when an operation is in progress and helping to manage user expectations.

The Spinner component is designed with flexibility in mind, accepting optional props to control its size and additional CSS classes. This design allows the Spinner component to be reused in various parts of the project, adapting to different contexts as needed. The use of SVG for the spinner and CSS for the animation ensures a smooth and efficient rendering, contributing to the overall performance of the user interface.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two files:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component, exporting the default export from `Spinner.tsx`. This setup simplifies imports elsewhere in the project, as the Spinner component can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` without specifying the `Spinner.tsx` file.
- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. The component accepts 'size' and 'className' as optional props, with 'size' controlling the spinner's dimensions and 'className' allowing for additional CSS classes. The spinner is created using SVG and includes an animation for the spinning effect.

The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Spinner.tsx` file. This file defines the Spinner component, which is a critical part of the user interface. The Spinner component provides a visual indication of a loading state, helping to manage user expectations and improve the user experience.

The `Spinner.tsx` file is designed with flexibility in mind, accepting optional props to control the size of the spinner and additional CSS classes. This design allows the Spinner component to be reused in various parts of the project, adapting to different contexts as needed.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate a loading state. It can be imported directly from `components/Spinner` thanks to the `index.ts` file, which exports the default export from `Spinner.tsx`.

The Spinner component accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop controls the dimensions of the spinner, defaulting to '1em' if not provided. The 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner, defaulting to an empty string if not provided.

Here is an example of how the Spinner component might be used in a component that fetches data:

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

const FetchingDataComponent = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData().finally(() => setIsLoading(false));
  }, []);

  return isLoading ? <Spinner size="2em" className="text-blue-500" /> : <DataDisplay />;
};
```

In this example, the Spinner component is displayed while the data is being fetched. The 'size' prop is set to '2em', making the spinner larger than its default size, and the 'className' prop is set to 'text-blue-500', applying a blue color to the spinner.
