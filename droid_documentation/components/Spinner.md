## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The Spinner component is a crucial part of the user interface, providing users with a visual cue that a process is ongoing, enhancing the overall user experience. The directory contains two files: `Spinner.tsx` and `index.ts`, which work together to define and export the Spinner component.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. It is a React component that renders a spinner, typically used to indicate a loading state in a user interface. The Spinner component accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop determines the height and width of the spinner, defaulting to '1em' if not provided. The 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner, defaulting to an empty string if not provided. The spinner is created using SVG and has an animation applied to it to create the spinning effect.
- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component. It exports the default export from the 'Spinner.tsx' file, which is the main Spinner component. This structure allows for cleaner imports elsewhere in the codebase, as one can import the Spinner component directly from 'components/Spinner' instead of having to specify the 'Spinner.tsx' file.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Spinner.tsx` file. This file defines the Spinner component, which is a crucial part of the user interface. The Spinner component provides a visual cue to the user that a process is ongoing, enhancing the overall user experience. It accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className', allowing for customization of its appearance. The spinner is created using SVG and includes an animation for the spinning effect.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate a loading state. It can be imported directly from 'components/Spinner' thanks to the `index.ts` file, which exports the Spinner component as its default export.

For example, the Spinner component might be used in a situation where data is being fetched from an API. While the data is being fetched, the Spinner component could be displayed to the user to indicate that the data is loading. Once the data has been fetched, the Spinner component could be replaced with the data.

```typescript
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

// ...

return (
  <div>
    {isLoading ? <Spinner size="2em" className="my-spinner" /> : <DataDisplay data={data} />}
  </div>
);
```

In this example, the Spinner component is displayed if the 'isLoading' state is true. The 'size' prop is set to '2em', making the spinner larger than its default size, and the 'className' prop is set to 'my-spinner', allowing for additional styling. Once the 'isLoading' state is false, the Spinner component is replaced with a 'DataDisplay' component that displays the fetched data.
