## `components/Sidebar` Directory

The `components/Sidebar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It houses the TypeScript files that define the Sidebar component and its functionalities. The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The directory also contains a subdirectory, `components/Sidebar/components`, which includes additional component files for managing the sidebar.

### Contents

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point, exporting the main Sidebar component from `Sidebar.tsx`.
- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior.
- `components/Sidebar/components`: This subdirectory contains additional component files for managing the sidebar, including `OpenCloseButton.tsx`, which exports two components responsible for opening and closing the sidebar.

### Key Components

The key components in the `components/Sidebar` directory are:

- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `components/Sidebar/components/OpenCloseButton.tsx`: This file exports two components, 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton', which are responsible for opening and closing the sidebar.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectories in the `components/Sidebar` directory are used to manage the sidebar in the chatbot UI. The `Sidebar.tsx` file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. The `SidebarButton.tsx` file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. The `components/Sidebar/components/OpenCloseButton.tsx` file exports two components, 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton', which are responsible for opening and closing the sidebar.

For example, the `SidebarButton.tsx` file defines a SidebarButton component that accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. The 'text' prop is a string that represents the button's label, the 'icon' prop is a JSX.Element that represents the button's icon, and the 'onClick' prop is a function that is executed when the button is clicked. The component returns a button element with specific styling and behavior.

```typescript
interface Props {
  text: string;
  icon: JSX.Element;
  onClick: () => void;
}

export const SidebarButton: FC<Props> = ({ text, icon, onClick }) => {};
```

Similarly, the `components/Sidebar/components/OpenCloseButton.tsx` file exports two components, 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton', which are used to open and close a sidebar in a user interface. Both components accept two props: 'onClick', a function that is triggered when the button is clicked, and 'side', a string that can be either 'left' or 'right', indicating the side of the screen where the sidebar is located.

```typescript
interface Props {
  onClick: any;
  side: 'left' | 'right';
}

export const CloseSidebarButton = ({ onClick, side }: Props) => {};

export const OpenSidebarButton = ({ onClick, side }: Props) => {};
```
