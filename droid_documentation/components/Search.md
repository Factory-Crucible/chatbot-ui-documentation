## components/Search Directory

The `components/Search` directory is a part of the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository, specifically within the `components` directory. This directory is dedicated to the Search component of the chatbot-ui project. The Search component is a critical part of the user interface, providing the functionality to search through the chatbot's content. It accepts three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' represents the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates this term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon clears the search input when clicked.

### Contents

The `components/Search` directory contains two main files:

- `Search.tsx`: This is a TypeScript React component file that exports a functional component named 'Search'. It defines the structure and functionality of the Search component.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the public interface for the directory, exporting the default from 'Search.tsx'. This is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, where the index file in a directory serves as the public interface for that directory.

### Key Components

The key components within the `components/Search` directory are the `Search.tsx` and `index.ts` files.

- `Search.tsx`: This file is the heart of the Search component. It defines the functional component 'Search' that takes in three props: 'placeholder', 'searchTerm', and 'onSearch'. The 'placeholder' is a string that is displayed when the search input is empty. The 'searchTerm' is the current search term, and 'onSearch' is a function that updates the search term. The component renders an input field and an 'X' icon. The input field displays the 'searchTerm' and calls 'onSearch' when its value changes. The 'X' icon, when clicked, clears the search input by calling 'onSearch' with an empty string.

- `index.ts`: This file is crucial as it exports the default export from the sibling file 'Search.tsx', making the Search component accessible to other parts of the codebase.

### Usage & Examples

The Search component is used within the chatbot-ui project to provide search functionality. It is a reusable component that can be imported into other components or pages where search functionality is required.

The Search component is typically used as follows:

```typescript
import Search from '../components/Search';

// In a functional component
const MyComponent: FC = () => {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

  const handleSearch = (term: string) => {
    setSearchTerm(term);
    // Perform search logic here
  };

  return (
    <Search
      placeholder="Search..."
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      onSearch={handleSearch}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example, the Search component is imported from the `components/Search` directory. It is then used in the `MyComponent` functional component, with a placeholder of "Search...", the `searchTerm` state variable, and the `handleSearch` function passed as props. The `handleSearch` function updates the `searchTerm` state variable and would typically also contain the logic to perform the search.
