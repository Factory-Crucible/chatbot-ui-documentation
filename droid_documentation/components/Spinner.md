## `components/Spinner` Directory

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the Spinner component of the chatbot-ui project. This component is a critical part of the user interface, providing a visual indication of a loading state. The Spinner component is a React component that displays a spinning animation, typically used when the application is processing data or waiting for a response from an API request. The directory contains two files: `Spinner.tsx` and `index.ts`. These files work together to define and export the Spinner component, making it available for use throughout the project.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

- `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. It is a React component that renders a spinner, typically used to indicate a loading state in the user interface. The Spinner component accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop determines the height and width of the spinner, defaulting to '1em' if not provided. The 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner, defaulting to an empty string if not provided. The spinner is created using SVG and has an animation applied to it to create the spinning effect.

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component. It exports the default export from the 'Spinner.tsx' file, which is the Spinner component itself. This structure allows for cleaner imports elsewhere in the codebase, as one can import the Spinner component directly from 'components/Spinner' instead of having to specify the 'Spinner.tsx' file.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the Spinner component, defined in the `Spinner.tsx` file. This component is crucial for providing feedback to the user when the application is processing data or waiting for a response from an API request. The Spinner component is designed to be flexible, accepting optional 'size' and 'className' props that control its dimensions and styling, respectively. This flexibility allows the Spinner component to be used in various parts of the application, adapting to different contexts and design requirements.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is used throughout the chatbot-ui project to indicate a loading state. It can be imported directly from the 'components/Spinner' directory, thanks to the export structure defined in the `index.ts` file.

Here is a simplified example of how the Spinner component might be used in a React component:

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate an API request
    setTimeout(() => {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }, 2000);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? <Spinner size="2em" className="text-blue-500" /> : 'Data loaded'}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

In this example, the Spinner component is displayed while the 'isLoading' state is true, simulating a loading state while an API request is being processed. The Spinner's size is set to '2em', and it is given a 'text-blue-500' class for styling. Once the 'isLoading' state is set to false, the Spinner is replaced with the text 'Data loaded'.
