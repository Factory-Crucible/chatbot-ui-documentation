## components/Spinner

The `components/Spinner` directory is dedicated to the implementation of a Spinner React component. This component is a visual element that displays a spinning animation, typically used to indicate a loading state in a user interface. The directory is structured in a way that it encapsulates all the necessary files related to the Spinner component, making it a self-contained unit within the codebase. This structure not only promotes modularity but also simplifies the process of importing the Spinner component in other parts of the project.

### Contents

The `components/Spinner` directory contains two TypeScript files:

1. `Spinner.tsx`: This file defines the Spinner component. It is a React component that renders a spinner, typically used to indicate loading state in a user interface. The Spinner component accepts two optional props: 'size' and 'className'. The 'size' prop determines the height and width of the spinner, defaulting to '1em' if not provided. The 'className' prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the spinner, defaulting to an empty string if not provided. The spinner is created using SVG and has an animation applied to it to create the spinning effect.

2. `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Spinner component in the project. It exports the default export from the 'Spinner.tsx' file, which is likely the main Spinner component. This structure allows for cleaner imports elsewhere in the codebase, as one can import the Spinner component directly from 'components/Spinner' instead of having to specify the 'Spinner.tsx' file.

The directory does not contain any subdirectories.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `Spinner.tsx` file. This file defines the Spinner component, which is a critical visual element used across the codebase to indicate loading states. The Spinner component is designed to be flexible and customizable, accepting optional 'size' and 'className' props. This flexibility allows it to be used in various contexts and styles throughout the application.

The `index.ts` file, while not defining any functionality itself, plays a crucial role in simplifying the import process of the Spinner component. By exporting the Spinner component as its default export, it allows other parts of the codebase to import the Spinner component directly from 'components/Spinner', improving code readability and maintainability.

### Usage & Examples

The Spinner component is primarily used in scenarios where the application needs to indicate a loading state to the user. It can be customized via its 'size' and 'className' props, allowing it to fit seamlessly into various parts of the application.

For instance, a typical usage of the Spinner component might look like this:

```jsx
import Spinner from 'components/Spinner';

// ...

return (
  <div>
    Loading data...
    <Spinner size="2em" className="my-spinner" />
  </div>
);
```

In this example, the Spinner component is imported from 'components/Spinner' (made possible by the `index.ts` file), and then used within a render method. The 'size' prop is set to '2em', making the spinner larger than its default size, and the 'className' prop is set to 'my-spinner', allowing additional styles to be applied to the spinner.
