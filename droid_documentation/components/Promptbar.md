The `Promptbar` component is a sidebar in the user interface of the chatbot, providing functionalities for managing prompts and folders. The directory contains TypeScript files and a subdirectory, each contributing to the overall functionality of the `Promptbar` component.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the entry point for the `Promptbar` component, exporting the component for use in other parts of the application.
- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This file defines the context for the `Promptbar` component, including state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file defines the initial state and interface for the `Promptbar` component.
- `components/Promptbar/components`: This subdirectory contains related components to the `Promptbar` component.

### Key Components

The `components/Promptbar` directory houses several key files and subdirectories:

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This context file is crucial as it outlines the shape of the context, including the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders. It is responsible for rendering the `Promptbar` and handling its functionalities.
- `components/Promptbar/components`: This subdirectory contains several TypeScript React components related to the `Promptbar` feature of the application. Each of these components contributes to the overall functionality of the `Promptbar`.

### Usage & Examples

The `Promptbar` component and its related files are used within the chatbot-ui project to manage prompts and folders in the user interface. The `Promptbar` component is imported into other parts of the application using the `index.ts` file. The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is used to provide a context for the `Promptbar` component, allowing state and handlers to be accessed throughout the component tree.

The `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI. It uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects. It also imports several other components such as 'PromptFolders', 'PromptbarSettings', and 'Prompts'. It also imports a context 'HomeContext' and a state 'Promptbar.state'.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory contains several related components. For example, the `Prompts.tsx` component is used to display a list of prompts in the user interface. The `Prompt.tsx` component handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and manages local state for various functionalities. The `PromptModal.tsx` component renders a modal for editing a prompt, with internationalization support. The `PromptFolders.tsx` component handles the display and functionality of folders within the `Promptbar`, including the dropping of prompts into folders.

The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file defines the initial state and interface for the `Promptbar` component. This state is used throughout the `Promptbar` component to manage the search term and filtered prompts.
