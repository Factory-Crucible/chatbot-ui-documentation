## `components/Markdown` Directory

The `components/Markdown` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to handling markdown rendering within the chatbot UI. It contains two TypeScript component files, `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx` and `CodeBlock.tsx`, which are responsible for rendering markdown content and displaying code blocks in markdown format respectively. These components are integral to the chatbot UI as they enhance the user experience by providing a visually appealing and efficient way to display markdown content and code snippets.

### Contents

The `components/Markdown` directory is a simple, yet crucial part of the codebase. It contains two TypeScript files:

- `MemoizedReactMarkdown.tsx`: This file exports a memoized functional component that uses the 'react-markdown' library to render markdown content. The component is optimized for performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders through memoization.

- `CodeBlock.tsx`: This file exports a functional component that displays code blocks in markdown format. It uses 'react-syntax-highlighter' for syntax highlighting and provides functionality to copy the code to clipboard and download the code as a file.

There are no subdirectories within the `components/Markdown` directory.

### Key Components

The `components/Markdown` directory houses two key components that play a significant role in the chatbot UI:

- `MemoizedReactMarkdown`: This component is responsible for rendering markdown content within the chatbot UI. It uses the 'react-markdown' library to convert markdown syntax into HTML. The component is memoized using React's 'memo' function, which optimizes performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders. This is particularly useful in a chatbot UI where the markdown content may not change frequently.

- `CodeBlock`: This component is used to display code blocks in markdown format. It enhances the user experience by providing syntax highlighting using 'react-syntax-highlighter', and additional functionalities like copying the code to clipboard and downloading the code as a file. The component also uses 'next-i18next' for internationalization, making it adaptable for different locales.

### Usage & Examples

The components within the `components/Markdown` directory are used throughout the chatbot UI to render markdown content and display code blocks.

For instance, the `MemoizedReactMarkdown` component could be used in a chat message component to render markdown content received from the chatbot. Here's a simplified example:

```typescript
import { MemoizedReactMarkdown } from './components/Markdown/MemoizedReactMarkdown';

function ChatMessage({ message }) {
  return (
    <div className="chat-message">
      <MemoizedReactMarkdown>{message.content}</MemoizedReactMarkdown>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `CodeBlock` component could be used within the `MemoizedReactMarkdown` component to render code blocks in the markdown content. Here's a simplified example:

```typescript
import { CodeBlock } from './components/Markdown/CodeBlock';

function MarkdownRenderer({ content }) {
  return (
    <ReactMarkdown
      components={{
        code({node, inline, className, children, ...props}) {
          const match = /language-(\w+)/.exec(className || '')
          return !inline && match
            ? <CodeBlock language={match[1]} value={String(children).replace(/\n$/, '')} {...props} />
            : <code className={className} {...props}>{children}</code>
        }
      }}
    >
      {content}
    </ReactMarkdown>
  );
}
```

These examples illustrate how the components in the `components/Markdown` directory are used within the chatbot UI to render markdown content and display code blocks in an efficient and visually appealing manner.
