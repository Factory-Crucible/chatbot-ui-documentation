## Styles Directory

The Styles directory is dedicated to the global styling of the project. It houses a single file, 'globals.css', which is responsible for defining the global styles that are applied throughout the project. This file is crucial in maintaining a consistent look and feel across the application, and it leverages the Tailwind CSS framework to achieve this. 

### Contents

The Styles directory contains one file:

- `globals.css`: This is a CSS file that holds the global styles for the project. It imports base, components, and utilities from the Tailwind CSS framework and includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar. The file also sets the HTML document's background color to a dark shade. It contains a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, adjusting the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. Additionally, it removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock'.

### Key Components

The key component in this directory is the `globals.css` file. This file is responsible for defining the global styles that are applied throughout the project. It leverages the Tailwind CSS framework to provide a utility-first approach to styling, which allows for more efficient and maintainable code. The file also includes custom styles for the webkit scrollbar and the HTML document's background color, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

### Usage & Examples

The `globals.css` file is used to define the global styles that are applied throughout the project. It is imported into the project's main entry point, allowing these styles to be applied to all components. The file includes a media query for screens with a maximum width of 720px, which adjusts the width of 'pre' elements under this condition. This ensures that the application's layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. Additionally, the file removes padding from 'pre' elements that contain a 'div' with the class 'codeblock', providing a cleaner presentation of code blocks.
