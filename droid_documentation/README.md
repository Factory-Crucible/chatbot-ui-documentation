Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. These docs are generated and will be kept up to date as the codebase changes by the Documentation Droid.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is designed to provide a user interface for a chatbot application. This repository is a crucial part of the larger Factory-Crucible project, which aims to create a comprehensive chatbot solution. The chatbot UI interacts with other services, such as the OpenAI API and Google Custom Search API, to provide a seamless and interactive user experience.

### Technologies used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies. It is a Docker-based Node.js project that uses TypeScript for static typing. The frontend is built using React, and the styling is managed by Tailwind CSS. The project also uses Kubernetes for container orchestration.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different aspect of the chatbot UI. The 'pages' directory contains key files and an 'api' subdirectory for handling API requests. The 'utils' directory contains utility files and subdirectories for different aspects of the project. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants. The 'k8s' directory contains Kubernetes configurations. The '__tests__' directory is for testing, with a 'utils' subdirectory as a testing suite.

### Conventions

The codebase follows several conventions. File naming follows the standard JavaScript and TypeScript conventions. The 'types' directory is used for defining TypeScript interfaces, types, and constants. The '__tests__' directory is used for testing. The 'utils' directory is used for utility functions, and the 'hooks' directory is used for custom React hooks.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. Here is a high-level overview of the directory structure:

```
.
├── __tests__
├── components
├── droid_documentation
├── hooks
├── k8s
├── pages
├── public
├── services
├── styles
├── types
└── utils
```

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase revolve around the chatbot UI. The 'components' directory houses the various parts of the UI, such as the chat bar, settings, and prompts. The 'pages' directory contains the main entry points and handles API interactions. The 'utils' directory provides utility functions for various aspects of the project, such as managing chat conversations and handling the import and export of chatbot data. The 'hooks' directory defines custom React hooks used throughout the project, and the 'services' directory provides services for error handling and API calls.

For a more in-depth understanding of the flows, refer to the following documentation files:

- [Components](./droid_documentation/components/README.md)
- [Pages](./droid_documentation/pages.md)
- [Utils](./droid_documentation/utils.md)
- [Hooks](./droid_documentation/hooks.md)
- [Services](./droid_documentation/services.md)

### System Connections

The codebase interacts with external services such as the OpenAI API and Google Custom Search API. The 'pages/api' directory contains files for handling these API requests and responses. The 'services' directory provides services for making these API calls.

## Testing Principles

The '__tests__' directory contains tests for the application. The tests are organized into a 'utils' subdirectory, which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. The 'importExports.test.ts' file validates the import and export operations of the application. For more details on testing, refer to the [Testing Documentation](./droid_documentation/__tests__.md).
