## utils

The `utils` directory is a collection of utility files and subdirectories that provide various functionalities to the chatbot UI project. These utilities range from managing chat conversations, saving folders to local storage, mapping programming languages to file extensions, to handling the import and export of chatbot data. The directory is divided into three subdirectories: `app`, `server`, and `data`, each serving a specific purpose.

### Contents

The `utils` directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- `app`: This subdirectory houses various utility files for a chatbot UI project. It manages everything from saving folders to local storage, mapping programming languages to file extensions, managing chat conversations, and handling the import and export of chatbot data.
- `server`: This subdirectory provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and a function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API. It also contains a function that standardizes text data.
- `data`: This subdirectory contains a 'throttle' function that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed.
- `.DS_Store`: This file has no available description.

### Key Components

- `app`: The `app` subdirectory is a key component of the `utils` directory. It contains several utility files that manage various aspects of the chatbot UI project. These include managing folders, mapping programming languages to file extensions, managing chat conversations, and handling the import and export of chatbot data.
- `server`: The `server` subdirectory is another critical component of the `utils` directory. It provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and a function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API.
- `data`: The `data` subdirectory contains a 'throttle' function that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed. This function is crucial for managing the performance of the application.

### Usage & Examples

The utility files and subdirectories in the `utils` directory are used throughout the codebase to provide various functionalities. For instance, the `app` subdirectory contains utility files that manage various aspects of the chatbot UI project, such as saving folders to local storage, mapping programming languages to file extensions, managing chat conversations, and handling the import and export of chatbot data.

The `server` subdirectory provides utility functions for server-side operations, including an 'OpenAIError' class and a function for making POST requests to the OpenAI API. These utilities are used to handle server-side operations and error handling.

The `data` subdirectory contains a 'throttle' function that controls the rate at which a given function can be executed. This function is used to manage the performance of the application by limiting the rate at which certain functions can be called.

For example, the `throttle` function in the `data` subdirectory can be used to limit the rate at which a function that makes API requests is called. This can prevent the application from making too many requests in a short period of time, which could lead to rate limiting or performance issues.
