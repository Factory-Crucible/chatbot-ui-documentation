## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project. It houses the `Promptbar` component, which is a sidebar in the user interface of the application. The `Promptbar` component is responsible for managing prompts and folders, providing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the chatbot. The directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory, each contributing to the functionality of the `Promptbar` component.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains five TypeScript files and one subdirectory. The TypeScript files include `index.ts`, `PromptBar.context.tsx`, `Promptbar.tsx`, and `Promptbar.state.tsx`. The `index.ts` file serves as the entry point for the `Promptbar` component, while `PromptBar.context.tsx` defines the context for the `Promptbar` component, including state and handlers for prompts. The `Promptbar.tsx` file is the main component file, and `Promptbar.state.tsx` defines the initial state and interface for the `Promptbar` component.

The subdirectory `components/Promptbar/components` contains related components such as `Prompts.tsx`, `PromptbarSettings.tsx`, `Prompt.tsx`, `PromptModal.tsx`, and `PromptFolders.tsx`. These components contribute to the functionality of the `Promptbar` component, handling various aspects such as rendering a list of prompts, managing prompts, rendering a modal for editing prompts, and managing folders within the `Promptbar`.

### Key Components

The `Promptbar.tsx` file is a key component in this directory. It represents the `Promptbar` component, a sidebar in the user interface of the application. This component manages prompts and folders, providing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the chatbot. It uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects, and imports several other components to handle different aspects of the `Promptbar`.

The `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is another critical component. It defines the context for the `Promptbar` component, including state and handlers for prompts. This context is used throughout the `Promptbar` component and its subcomponents to manage state and handle user interactions.

The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file is also important, as it defines the initial state and interface for the `Promptbar` component. This state is used in the `Promptbar` component to manage the state of prompts and folders.

### Usage & Examples

The `Promptbar` component is used within the chatbot-ui project to provide a sidebar in the user interface. This sidebar allows users to interact with prompts and folders, providing a user-friendly interface for the chatbot.

For example, the `Promptbar` component uses the `PromptbarContext` to manage the state of prompts and folders. It provides handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts, and also handles the dropping of prompts into folders.

The `Promptbar` component also uses the `Promptbar.state.tsx` file to define its initial state. This state includes a `searchTerm` and `filteredPrompts`, which are used to manage the display of prompts in the `Promptbar`.

The `Promptbar` component imports several subcomponents from the `components/Promptbar/components` directory. These subcomponents handle various aspects of the `Promptbar`, such as rendering a list of prompts (`Prompts.tsx`), managing prompts (`Prompt.tsx`), rendering a modal for editing prompts (`PromptModal.tsx`), and managing folders within the `Promptbar` (`PromptFolders.tsx`).
