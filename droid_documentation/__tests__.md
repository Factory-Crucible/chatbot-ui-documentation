## **tests** Directory

The `__tests__` directory is dedicated to testing within the project. It houses a subdirectory named `utils` that serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. The `utils` directory further contains a subdirectory named `app`, which includes a test file `importExports.test.ts`. This file validates the import and export operations of the application, ensuring that the objects being exported conform to the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, designed to update data from older export formats to the latest one, verifying that the updated data aligns with the expected structure of the current format.

### Contents

The `__tests__` directory contains the following subdirectory:

- `utils`: A testing suite for utility functions within the application. It houses the `app` subdirectory.

### Key Components

- `importExports.test.ts`: A test file located in the `app` subdirectory of `utils`. It validates the functionality of import and export operations, ensuring that exported objects align with the expected format for each version. It also tests the `cleanData` function, which updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

### Usage & Examples

The `__tests__` directory is used for testing various aspects of the application. For instance, the `importExports.test.ts` file tests the import and export operations of the application. It checks whether a given object matches the expected format for each version and whether the `cleanData` function correctly updates data from older export formats to the latest one.

```typescript
describe('Export Format Functions', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV1', () => {});
it('should return true for v1 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v1 formats', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV2', () => {});
it('should return true for v2 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v2 formats', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV3', () => {});
it('should return true for v3 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v3 formats', () => {});
describe('isExportFormatV4', () => {});
it('should return true for v4 format', () => {});
it('should return false for non-v4 formats', () => {});
describe('cleanData Functions', () => {});
describe('cleaning v1 data', () => {});
it('should return the latest format', () => {});
describe('cleaning v2 data', () => {});
it('should return the latest format', () => {});
describe('cleaning v4 data', () => {});
it('should return the latest format', () => {});
```
This code snippet is a skeleton of the tests performed in the `importExports.test.ts` file. It outlines the structure of the tests for different versions of the export format and the `cleanData` function.
