## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the React application, housing TypeScript files and a subdirectory that together form the `Promptbar` component. This component represents a sidebar in the user interface, providing functions for managing prompts and folders. The `Promptbar` component is a complex entity, with its state and context defined in separate files, and its related components housed in a dedicated subdirectory.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains the following files and subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: Serves as the entry point, exporting the `Promptbar` component.
- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: Defines the context for the `Promptbar` component, including state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: The main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: Defines the initial state and interface for the `Promptbar` component.
- `components/Promptbar/components`: A subdirectory containing related components.

### Key Components

The `Promptbar` directory houses several critical files:

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This file is crucial as it defines the context for the `Promptbar` component. It outlines the shape of the context, including the state, dispatch function, and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI. It is responsible for managing prompts and folders, making it a key part of the application's functionality.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file defines the initial state and interface for the `Promptbar` component, providing a clear structure for the component's state.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subdirectory within the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to build and manage the `Promptbar` component within the codebase. For instance, the `PromptBar.context.tsx` file is used to define the context for the `Promptbar` component, including state and handlers for prompts. This context is then used within the `Promptbar.tsx` file to manage the component's state and handle user interactions.

The `Promptbar.state.tsx` file is used to define the initial state and interface for the `Promptbar` component. This state is then used within the `Promptbar.tsx` file to initialize the component's state.

The `components/Promptbar/components` subdirectory houses related components that are used within the `Promptbar` component. These components are responsible for rendering various parts of the `Promptbar`, such as the list of prompts, the settings, and the modal for editing prompts.
