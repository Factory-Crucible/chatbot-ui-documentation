## `components/Mobile` Directory

The `components/Mobile` directory is a specialized section of the codebase dedicated to the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a part of the larger `components` directory, which houses various parts of the project, each responsible for a specific part of the user interface and functionality of the chatbot. The `components/Mobile` directory specifically contains files related to the mobile version of the application, focusing on the navigation bar functionality in the mobile chat application.

### Contents

The `components/Mobile` directory is straightforward in its structure, containing a single TypeScript file, `Navbar.tsx`, and no subdirectories. The `Navbar.tsx` file is a critical component of the mobile application, defining a functional component named 'Navbar' that is used in the navigation bar of the mobile chat application.

- `Navbar.tsx`: This TypeScript file defines a functional component named 'Navbar'. The component is designed to be used in the navigation bar of a chat application. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation', which is an object of type 'Conversation', and 'onNewConversation', which is a function that gets triggered when a new conversation is started. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button that, when clicked, triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

### Key Components

The `Navbar.tsx` file is the key component in this directory. It defines the 'Navbar' functional component, which is specifically designed for the mobile application's navigation bar. This component is critical to the mobile user interface, providing the user with the ability to view the currently active chat and initiate new conversations.

- `Navbar` Component: This functional component is designed for the mobile application's navigation bar. It accepts two props: 'selectedConversation' and 'onNewConversation'. The 'selectedConversation' prop is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat. The 'onNewConversation' prop is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated. The component displays the name of the selected conversation and an 'IconPlus' button. When this button is clicked, it triggers the 'onNewConversation' function.

### Usage & Examples

The `Navbar` component defined in the `Navbar.tsx` file is used within the mobile version of the chatbot-ui application. It is a part of the navigation bar, displaying the currently active chat and providing the user with the ability to initiate new conversations.

Here is a simplified example of how the `Navbar` component might be used:

```typescript
<Navbar
  selectedConversation={currentConversation}
  onNewConversation={handleNewConversation}
/>
```

In this example, `currentConversation` is an object of type 'Conversation' representing the currently active chat, and `handleNewConversation` is a function that is triggered when a new conversation is initiated. When the 'IconPlus' button within the `Navbar` component is clicked, it triggers the `handleNewConversation` function, allowing the user to start a new conversation.
