# Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository. This document serves as the entry point for developers to understand the codebase. The documentation is generated and maintained by the Documentation Droid, ensuring it remains up-to-date as the codebase evolves.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Factory-Crucible/chatbot-ui-documentation repository is dedicated to the development of a chatbot user interface (UI). The chatbot UI is a crucial component of the larger Factory-Crucible ecosystem, interacting with various services to provide a seamless user experience.

### Technologies Used

The codebase heavily relies on several leading technologies. It is a Docker-based Node.js project that uses TypeScript for static typing. The frontend is built using ReactJS, while the backend services are defined and managed using Kubernetes. The project also utilizes various tools like Makefile, Prettier, PostCSS, and Tailwind CSS for development and deployment.

### Major Components

The codebase consists of several major components. The 'components' directory houses various parts of the project, each representing a different aspect of the chatbot UI. The 'pages' directory contains key files that serve as entry points to the codebase. The 'services' directory contains services for error handling and API calls. The 'types' directory defines various interfaces, types, and constants used throughout the project.

### Conventions

The codebase follows certain conventions for better understanding and maintainability. File naming follows a consistent pattern, with the file name indicating its purpose. For example, 'Chatbar.tsx' is a React component representing the chat bar, and 'chat.ts' serves as an API endpoint for chat functionality.

## Structure

The structure of the codebase is organized into various directories, each serving a specific purpose. Some directories contain a significant amount of code, while others contain static assets and are rarely utilized. The structure is outlined using the PROJECT_STRUCTURE, providing a detailed overview of important directories.

## Main Flows

### Overview Of Flows

The main flows in the codebase are designed to facilitate specific user stories. Some patterns recur in many cases in the repo, while some occur once but are called frequently, making them important to understand. The flow of data from one end of the system to the other is managed through these flows. For a more in-depth understanding of these flows, refer to the respective documentation files in the directory.

### System Connections

The system connections, both internal and external, are crucial for understanding the dependencies of the codebase. The interaction between different code areas can drastically ease onboarding and clarify the constituents and interactions involved. The services or components are placed in the codebase in a way that they interact with each other at a high level.

## Testing Principles

The codebase follows certain testing principles to ensure the robustness and reliability of the code. The '**tests**' directory is dedicated to testing within the project. It contains a subdirectory named 'utils', which serves as a testing suite for the application's utility functions. For more details, refer to [`__tests__.md`](./__tests__.md).
