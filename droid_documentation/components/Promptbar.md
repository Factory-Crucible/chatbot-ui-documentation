## components/Promptbar

The `components/Promptbar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot-ui project. It houses the TypeScript files and a subdirectory that define and manage the 'Promptbar' component of the application. The 'Promptbar' component represents a sidebar in the user interface, providing functions for managing prompts and folders. This directory is a testament to the modular architecture of the project, encapsulating all the necessary files and subcomponents related to the 'Promptbar' feature in one place.

### Contents

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as the entry point for the 'Promptbar' component, exporting the default export from the 'Promptbar.tsx' file.
- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This file defines the context for the 'Promptbar' component, including state and handlers for prompts.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file, representing a sidebar in the UI, with functions for managing prompts and folders.
- `Promptbar.state.tsx`: This file defines the initial state and interface for the 'Promptbar' component.
- `components/Promptbar/components`: This subdirectory contains related components such as 'Prompts.tsx', 'PromptbarSettings.tsx', 'Prompt.tsx', 'PromptModal.tsx', and 'PromptFolders.tsx'.

### Key Components

The `components/Promptbar` directory contains several key files and subcomponents that contribute to the functionality of the 'Promptbar' feature:

- `PromptBar.context.tsx`: This context file is crucial as it provides the state and handlers for creating, deleting, and updating prompts. It defines the 'PromptbarContextProps' interface which outlines the shape of the context, including the state, dispatch function, and handlers.
- `Promptbar.tsx`: This is the main component file for the 'Promptbar'. It uses various hooks and contexts to manage state and effects, and imports several other components and contexts. It also handles actions like toggling the prompt bar, creating, deleting, and updating prompts, and dropping prompts into folders.
- `components/Promptbar/components/Prompt.tsx`: This component handles actions, updates, and deletions of prompts, and manages local state for various functionalities. It uses the 'PromptbarContext' to dispatch actions and handle updates and deletions of prompts.
- `components/Promptbar/components/PromptFolders.tsx`: This component handles the display and functionality of folders within the 'Promptbar', including the dropping of prompts into folders.

### Usage & Examples

The files and subcomponents within the `components/Promptbar` directory are used to manage the 'Promptbar' feature of the chatbot-ui application. For instance, the 'Promptbar.tsx' file is the main component file for the 'Promptbar', and it uses the 'PromptbarContext' and 'Promptbar.state' to manage state and effects. It also imports several other components from the 'components/Promptbar/components' subdirectory to handle specific functionalities related to prompts and folders.

The 'Prompt.tsx' component, for example, is used to handle actions, updates, and deletions of prompts. It uses the 'PromptbarContext' to dispatch actions and handle updates and deletions of prompts. It also manages local state for showing a modal, deleting, renaming, and the rename value.

The 'PromptFolders.tsx' component is used to handle the display and functionality of folders within the 'Promptbar'. It maps through filtered prompts and returns a 'PromptComponent' for each prompt in the current folder. It also handles the dropping of prompts into folders, updating the prompt's folderId when dropped.

The 'PromptModal.tsx' component is used to render a modal for editing a prompt. It provides input fields for the name, description, and content of the prompt, and listens for 'Enter' key press to update the prompt and close the modal.

The 'PromptbarSettings.tsx' component, although currently returning an empty div, is likely used to render settings related to the 'Promptbar' component within the application.
