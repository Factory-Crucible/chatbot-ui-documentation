## components/Sidebar

The `components/Sidebar` directory is a crucial part of the chatbot UI project. It houses the TypeScript files that define the Sidebar component and its functionalities. The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The Sidebar component is a key part of the user interface, providing a navigational structure for the application.

### Contents

The `components/Sidebar` directory contains several TypeScript files and a subdirectory:

- `index.ts`: This file serves as an entry point for the Sidebar component, exporting the main Sidebar component from 'Sidebar.tsx'.
- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'.
- `components/Sidebar/components`: This subdirectory contains additional component files for managing the sidebar. Notably, it includes 'OpenCloseButton.tsx', which exports two components responsible for opening and closing the sidebar.

### Key Components

The key components in the `components/Sidebar` directory are:

- `Sidebar.tsx`: This file defines the Sidebar component, which is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization. The Sidebar component is a key part of the user interface, providing a navigational structure for the application.
- `SidebarButton.tsx`: This file defines a SidebarButton component with specific styling and behavior. It accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. The SidebarButton component is used extensively within the Sidebar component to provide interactive elements for the user.

### Usage & Examples

The files in the `components/Sidebar` directory are used to create the Sidebar component of the chatbot UI. The Sidebar component is a functional component that handles various actions and renders different layouts based on its state. It uses the 'react-i18next' library for internationalization.

The `Sidebar.tsx` file defines the Sidebar component. This component accepts a variety of props, including flags for whether it's open, the side it should appear on, and handlers for various actions such as creating items and folders, and handling search terms. It also accepts components to render items, folders, and a footer.

The `SidebarButton.tsx` file defines a SidebarButton component. This button is designed to be used in a sidebar. The SidebarButton component accepts three props: 'text', 'icon', and 'onClick'. 'text' is a string that represents the button's label, 'icon' is a JSX.Element that represents the button's icon, and 'onClick' is a function that is executed when the button is clicked.

The `components/Sidebar/components/OpenCloseButton.tsx` file exports two components: 'CloseSidebarButton' and 'OpenSidebarButton'. These components are used to open and close a sidebar in a user interface. Both components accept two props: 'onClick', a function that is triggered when the button is clicked, and 'side', a string that can be either 'left' or 'right', indicating the side of the screen where the sidebar is located.
